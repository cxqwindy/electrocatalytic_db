However, efficient conversion of CO2 to produce fuels remains a challenge because a proper electrocatalyst is needed to make this CO2 reduction process more selective and efficient. In this study, we prepared nanostructured tungstate-derived copper to test its application in CO2 reduction. The prepared copper tungstate (CuWO4) nanomaterials were first characterized by analytical techniques such as transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to determine the particle size, crystallinity, purity, and composition. Then, the CuWO4 nanomaterials were further investigated in an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M NaOH by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) techniques. The CO2 electroreduction experiments were carried out in 0.1 M NaOH with the presence of CO2, and the analysis of electrochemical results shows that nanostructured CuWO4 performs better in comparison with CuO-a well-known electrocatalyst for reducing CO, to nongaseous carbon-containing products such as alcohols-because of poisoning effects of adsorbed CO, or its adsorbed-reduced intermediates on hydrogen evolution reaction. Our results also show that CO2-reduction intermediates adsorbed strongly on the surface of CuWO4, which increases the overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction on the surface of CuWO 4 by as much as 230 mV against the 70 mV for CuO, at a current density of 0.8 mA cm(-2).\nDoi:10.1021_acs.jpcc.9b07133", "label": [[508, 523, "structure control"], [621, 626, "CuMOx"], [1304, 1306, "CO"]]}

Carbonsupported Cu nanoparticles are suitable candidates for integration in the state-ofthe-art reaction interfaces, and here, we propose, synthesize, and evaluate a bifunctional Ni-N-doped-C-supported Cu electrocatalyst, in which the support possesses active sites for selective CO2 conversion to CO and Cu nanoparticles catalyze either the direct CO2 or CO reduction to hydrocarbons.

From the practical aspect, the deposition of Cu nanoparticles onto carbon black and Ni-N-C supports via an ammonia-driven deposition precipitation method is reported and explored in more detail using X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) give further evidence of the presence of Cu-containing nanoparticles on the Ni-N-C supports while revealing an additional relationship between the nanoparticle's composition and the electrode's electrocatalytic performance.

Sulfur (S)-modified Cu electrodes were reported to selectively reduce CO2 into formic acid and fully quench the original CO2 production on clean Cu surfaces, yet the actual mechanism is still unsolved. To further understand this critical issue, herein, an integrated structure-selectivity investigation on the role of sulfur upon CO2 electroreduction was carried out. DFT calculations in combination with relevant experimental observations from the literature were utilized to identify the existing forms of sulfur and their impact of the reaction selectivity of CO2 to HCOOH under realistic conditions. Interestingly, most residual sulfur atoms were found to exist in relatively unstable forms during the reaction, which plays a dominant role in altering the reaction pathway by enhancing CO2 adsorption. In turn, these strongly adsorbed CO2 stabilize the unstable sulfur, and a synergetic effect between CO2 and S is proposed.

In the current study, the crystalline and valency factors that influence the CO2R activities of OD-Cu are revisited by employing single crystal Cu(111) foils that exclude convolutions from initial morphological and crystallographic heterogeneity. We observe that the overall CO2R performance, especially the C2H4 selectivity, correlates well with the initial oxidation level of the Cu(111) foil, of which the surface oxide layer is reduced into small fragments comprising rich grain boundaries and diversely orientated facets. Nonetheless, we find that the polycrystallinity and grain boundaries of OD-Cu, in this circumstance, are not the major causes of the observed activity enhancement. Instead, a transition state between the initial oxide and the finally reduced copper phases, as well as its longevity, dictates the catalytic property of OD-Cu in electrochemical CO2 reduction.

It was found that residual S beneath the Cu-0 layer lowered the binding energies of intermediates HCOO* and *COOH, promoting their desorption and the successive formation of HCOOH or HCOO-, thus regulating the high selectivity of the product. This work provides a convenient and economical method for developing a highly active electrocatalyst for producing HCOOH in CO2 electroreduction, and it is beneficial to understand the mechanism of enhanced selectivity to HCOO- for CuS electrode materials.\nDoi:10.1021_acsaem.0c03190", "label": [[130, 137, "HCOOH"], [454, 559, "Faradaic efficiency"], [6, 9, "CuSx"], [387, 407, "structure control"]]}

This tunability is used to correlate the role of the surface area and catalyst dopants with the selectivity of the CO2RR. The liquid products of the CO2RR are monitored through ex situ nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The products' distribution shows that the electrode surface area plays a key role in the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into multicarbon liquid products.

A Sn electrodeposition time of 120 s led to a cathode with a formate Faradaic efficiency of around 81% at -1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which was more than 37% higher than those of the Sn foil and the sample treated for 684 s. This result highlights the significant role of the interface between deposited Sn and the cuprous-derived substrate in determining the selectivity of CO2R. High-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectra revealed that the residual cuprous species at the Cu/Sn interfaces could stabilize Sn species in oxidation states of 2+ and 4+, a mixture of which is essential for a selective formate conversion. Such modulation effects likely arise from the moderate electronegativity of the cuprous species that is lower than that of Sn2+ but higher than that of Sn4+.

Although many researchers have demonstrated selective and stable catalysts for electrochemical reduction of pure CO2 gas, the conversion of industrial CO2 gas has been limited. Here, we fabricated the copper sulfide catalysts (CuSx), which were spontaneously formed by dipping a Cu foil into a laboratory-prepared industrial CO2-purged 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte. Because industrial CO2 contains H2S gas, sulfur species dissolved in the electrolyte can easily react with the Cu foil. As the concentration of dissolved sulfur species increased, the reaction between the Cu foil and sulfur enhanced. As a result, the average size and surface density of CuSx nanoparticles (NPs) increased to 133.2 +/- 33.1 nm and 86.2 +/- 3.3%, respectively. Because of the larger amount of sulfur content and the enlarged electrochemical surface area of CuSx NPs, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate was improved from 22.7 to 72.0% at -0.6 VRHE.

In this work, to achieve a favorable reaction rate and product selectivity, we designed and synthesized an asymmetric porous Cu hollow fiber gas diffusion electrode (HFGDE) with controlled Sn surface electrodeposition. The HFGDE derived from the optimal Sn electrodeposition condition exhibited a formate Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 78% and a current density of 88 mA cm(-2) at -1.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which are more than 2 times higher than those from the pristine Cu HFGDE.

The enhancement of formate production selectivity and the suppression of the hydrogen by-product were attributed to the optimized ratio of SnOx species on the electrode surface. The best performance was seen in the HFGDE with the highest Sn2+/Sn4+ (120 s deposition), likely due to the modulating effect of the Cu substrate via electron donation with Sn species.

Cu2O nanoparticles (NPs) of various morphologies that were enclosed with different crystal facets, named as Cu2O-c (cubic structure with (100) facets), Cu2O-o (octahedron structure with (111) facets), Cu2O-t (truncated octahedron structure with both (100) and (111) facets), and Cu2O-u (urchin-like structure with (100), (220), and (222) facets), were prepared by regulating the content of a polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) template.

The alcohol selectivity of the different Cu2O NPs followed the order of Cu2O-t < Cu2O-u < Cu2O-c < Cu2O-o (with the total Faradaic efficiencies of alcohol products of 10.7, 25.0, 26.2, and 35.4%). The facet-dependent effects were associated with the varied concentrations of oxygen-vacancy defects, different energy barriers of CO2 reduction, and distinct Cu-O bond lengths over the different crystal facets.

Herein, we demonstrate highly selective production of formate through CO2RR from a CO2-saturated aqueous bicarbonate solution using a porous In55Cu45 alloy as the electrocatalyst. This novel high-surface-area material was produced by means of an electrodeposition process utilizing the dynamic hydrogen bubble template approach.

A maximum FEformate of 96.8%, corresponding to a partial current density of j(formate) = -8.9 mA cm(-2), was yielded at -1.0 V vs RHE. The experimental findings suggested a CO2RR mechanism involving stabilization of the HCOO* intermediate on the In55Cu45 alloy surface in combination with effective suppression of the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction.

Here, we demonstrate a two-step tandem electrocatalytic E-CO2R with efficient conversion of the intermediate species. The catalyst scaffold is Si(100), which is etched to form a textured surface consisting of micron-sized pyramid structures with the {111} facets.

Its manufacture is based on the dynamic hydrogen bubble template method that consists of the superposition of metal deposition and hydrogen evolution at the solid liquid interface. We employed Cu ions in the Zn2+-rich electroplating bath as foaming agent. The concentration of Cu as foaming agent was systematically studied and an optimized Zn94Cu6 foam alloy was developed, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the most selective Zn-based CO2 electrocatalyst toward CO in aqueous bicarbonate solution (FECO = 90% at -0.95 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode). This high efficiency is ascribed to the combination of high density of low-coordinated active sites and preferential Zn(101) over Zn(002) texturing. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy investigations demonstrate that the actual catalyst material is shaped upon reduction of an oxide/hydroxide-terminating surface under CO2 electrolysis conditions. Moreover, intentional stressing by oxidation at room conditions proved to be beneficial for further activation of the catalyst.

The Cu-based catalysts feature unique superiorities; nevertheless, achieving high hydrocarbon selectivity is still inhibited and remains a great challenge.

The efficiency and composition of syngas production on the developed carbon-supported Cu/In2O3 catalysts are highly dependent on the In2O3 shell thickness (0.4-1.5 nm). As a result, a wide H-2/CO ratio (4/1 to 0.4/1) was achieved on the Cu/In2O3 catalysts by controlling the shell thickness and the applied potential (from -0.4 to -0.9 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode), with Faraday efficiency of syngas formation larger than 90%. Specifically, the best-performing Cu/In2O3 catalyst demonstrates remarkably large current densities under low overpotentials (4.6 and 12.7 mA/cm(2) at -0.6 and -0.9 V, respectively), which are competitive with most of the reported systems for syngas formation.

Bimetallic AgCu foams prepared by hydrogen bubble templated electrodeposition shift the potentials of CO production to more positive values compared to bulk silver. The presence of Ag during the electrodeposition significantly changed the size and the shape of the dendrites in the pore walls of AgCu foams compared to Cu foam.

We were successful in increasing the CO mass activity with respect to the total Ag amount.

The uniform planar morphology served as a platform to evaluate the electronic effect isolated from morphological effects while minimizing geometric contributions. The catalytic selectivity and activity of Au-Cu alloys was found to be correlated with the variation of electronic structure that was varied with tunable composition. Notably, the d-band center gradually shifted away from the Fermi level with increasing Au atomic ratio, leading to a weakened binding energy of *CO, which is consistent with low CO coverage observed in CO stripping experiments. The decrease in the *CO binding strength results in the enhanced catalytic activity for CO formation with the increase in Au content. In addition, it was observed that copper oxide/hydroxide species are less stable on Au-Cu surfaces compared to those on the pure Cu surface, where the surface oxophilicity could be critical to tuning the binding strength of *OCHO. These results imply that the altered electronic structure could explain the decreased formation of HCOO- on the Au-Cu alloys. In general, the formation of CO and HCOO- as main CO2 reduction products on planar Au-Cu alloys followed the shift of the d-band center, which indicates that the electronic effect is the major governing factor for the electrocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction on Au-Cu bimetallic thin films.\nDoi:10.1021_acsami.9b01553", "label": [[61, 66, "Cu-M"], [536, 543, "alloy"], [1403, 1406, "CO"]]}

Although copper (Cu)-based catalysts produce hydrocarbons with relatively high selectivity during CO2 electroreduction, such catalysts evolve a certain amount of H-2 via proton reduction reactions. Because low-coordinated Cu sites are likely active for the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), hindering such low-coordinated Cu sites by decoration with inert metal atoms is a promising approach to increasing the selectivity of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) over the HER. In the present study, we synthesized tin (Sn)-modified Cu nanoparticles with varied Sn ratios via a simple wet-chemical method. Physical and theoretical characterizations revealed that Sn atoms preferentially locate at the low-coordinated sites when Sn is present at low contents (less than 1.5%). Compared with the bare Cu catalyst, the Sn-modified Cu electrocatalyst shows suppression of the HER and acceleration of the carbon monoxide (CO) evolution reaction. The first-principles calculations about the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates revealed that low-coordinated Cu sites with the modification of Sn atoms exhibited lower activity for both HER and CO2RR than that without modification. As a result, the activity of coordinatively saturated Cu atoms, where the CO2RR is more favorable than the HER, was emphasized.

Controlled potential electrolysis of CO2 using an MT-Cu electrode at -1.8 V at Ag/AgCl exhibits greater selectivity for C-2 products than an unmodified polycrystalline Cu electrode (bare Cu).

Examination of the ratio of partial current densities for multicarbon products relative to CO and CH4 suggests increased CO insertion and hydrogenation on the tensile-strained Cu(001) surface, driven by a change in the adsorbate bonding because of an increased interaction with the upshifted d-band. This work provides direct experimental evidence on model thin film CO2 catalysts that strain can be systematically manipulated as a valuable tool, independent of catalyst composition, for the design of efficient CO2 electrocatalysts toward energy-dense products.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.0c05671", "label": [[54, 56, "Cu"], [932, 953, "C2+"], [1355, 1414, "structure control"]]}

In this joint experimental-computational work, we exploit structural sensitivity effects to elucidate the ethanol-producing active sites on Cu-Ag CO2RR tandem catalysts. Specifically, methane-selective Cu nano-octahedra (Cu-oh), enclosed by (111) facets, and ethylene-selective Cu nanocubes (Cu-cub), enclosed by (100) facets, are mixed with CO-selective Ag nanospheres (Ag-sph) to form Cu-oh-(A)g and Cu-cub-Ag bimetallic catalysts. Ethanol is selectively enhanced via the *CHx-*CO coupling pathway at the terraces of Cuoh-Ag in the CO-enriched environment generated by the Ag-sph. Conversely, on Cu-cub-Ag, ethanol is selectively produced via the same pathway at the edges and corners of Cu-cub, while ethylene continues to be produced at the terraces. The terraces being the predominant surfaces on the catalysts, such facet dependence explains the higher ethanol-to-ethylene ratio on the Cuoh-Ag. These findings illustrate how tandem catalysis and structure-sensitive effects can be combined to obtain notable changes in the selectivity of electrochemical reactions.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.1c00420", "label": [[78, 86, "C2H5OH"], [89, 94, "Cu-M"], [21, 49, "structure control"]]}

Comparing the production rate and Faradaic selectivity of the major products as a function the working potential in the presence of Cl-, Br-, and I-, we show that the activity and selectivity of Cu depends on the concentration and nature of the added halide. We find that the addition Cl- and Br- results in an increased CO selectivity. On the contrary, in the presence of I- the selectivity toward CO drops down and instead methane formation is enhanced up to 6 times compared with the halide-free electrolyte. Even though Br- and I- can induce morphology changes of the surface, the modification in the catalytic performance of Cu is mainly attributed to halides adsorption on the Cu surface. We hypothesizes that the adsorption of halides alters the catalytic performance of Cu by increasing the negative charge on the surface according to the following order: Cl- < Br- < I-. In the case of adsorbed I-, the induced negative charge has a remarkably positive effect favoring the protonation of CO. These results present an easy way to enhance CH4 production during the CO2RR on Cu.

The partial current of C2 product formation was found to be higher than that of the (parasitic) hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at any potential studied (-0.4 to 1.0 vs the reversible hydrogen electrode). Moreover, formate production could largely be suppressed at any applied potential down to efficiencies (FEformate) of <= 6%. A key point of the Cu foam catalyst activation is the in operando reduction of a Cu2O phase, thereby creating a large abundance of surface sites active for C-C coupling. The cuprous oxide phase has been formed after the Cu electrodeposition step by exposing the large-surface area catalyst to air at room temperature. The superior selectivity of the Cu foam catalyst studied herein originates from a combination of two effects, the availability of specific surface sites for C C coupling [dominant (100) surface texture] and the temporal trapping of gaseous intermediates (in particular CO and C2H4) inside the mesoporous catalyst material during CO2 electrolysis. A systematic CO2 electrolysis study reveals a strong dependence of the C2 efficiencies on the particular surface pore size of the mesoporous Cu catalysts with a maximal FEC2 between 50 and 100 mu m pore diameters.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.6b00770", "label": [[99, 101, "Cu"], [279, 291, "C2+"], [1446, 1509, "structure control"]]}

The bimetallic electrode was prepared through the electrodeposition of Sn species on the surface of oxide-derived copper (OD-Cu). The Cu surface, when decorated with an optimal amount of Sn, resulted in a Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO greater than 90% and a current density of -1.0 mA cm(-2) at -0.6 V vs RHE, compared to the CO FE of 63% and -2.1 mA cm(-2) for OD-Cu. Excess Sn on the surface caused H-2 evolution with a decreased current density. X-ray diffraction (XRD) suggests the formation of Cu Sn alloy. Auger electron spectroscopy of the sample surface exhibits zerovalent Cu and Sn after the electrodeposition step. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that replacing a single Cu atom with a Sn atom leaves the d-band orbitals mostly unperturbed, signifying no dramatic shifts in the bulk electronic structure. However, the Sn atom discomposes the multifold sites on pure Cu, disfavoring the adsorption of H and leaving the adsorption of CO relatively unperturbed. Our catalytic results along with DFT calculations indicate that the presence of Sn on reduced OD-Cu diminishes the hydrogenation capability-i.e., the selectivity toward H-2 and HCOOH-while hardly affects the CO productivity. While the pristine monometallic surfaces (both Cu and Sn) fail to selectively reduce CO2, the Cu Sn bimetallic electrocatalyst generates a surface that inhibits adsorbed H*, resulting in improved CO FE.

In this work, we prepared Cu-In nanoalloys by the in situ reduction of CuInO2 and In2O3-supported Cu nanoparticles and found that the structure of these nanoalloys evolves substantially over several electrocatalytic cycles, in parallel with an increase in the activity and selectivity for CO evolution. By combining electrochemical measurements with ex situ characterization techniques, such as XRD, STEM, elemental mapping, and XPS, we show that this behavior is caused by the segregation of copper and indium in these materials, resulting in the formation of a heterogeneous nanostructure of Cu-rich cores embedded within an In(OH)(3) shell-like matrix. The evolved catalysts show high electrocatalytic performance at moderate overpotential (i.e., j(CO) > 1.5 mA cm(-2) at -0.6 V vs RHE). We found that the removal of In(OH)(3) from these heterogeneous nanostructures decreases the performance of the evolved catalysts, particularly in terms of the selectivity toward CO, which then recovers with the reappearance of the hydroxide following the re-equilibration of the material. On the other hand, an In(OH)(3)-supported Cu catalyst exhibits a current efficiency for CO comparable to that of the evolved nanoalloys without the need for an equilibration stage, indicating that In(OH)(3) plays a crucial role in favoring the production of CO over Cu-In electrocatalysts.

Copper (Cu) and its oxides are by far the most effective electrocatalysts for this purpose. However, the formation of ethanol using these catalysts is generally less favored in comparison to that of ethylene. In this work, we demonstrate that the selectivity of CO2 reduction toward ethanol could be tuned by introducing a cocatalyst to generate an in situ source of mobile CO reactant. Cu-based oxides with different amounts of Zn dopants (Cu, Cu10Zn, Cu4Zn, and Cu2Zn) were prepared and used as catalysts under ambient pressure in aqueous 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte. By varying the amount of Zn in the bimetallic catalysts, we found that the selectivity of ethanol versus ethylene production, defined by the ratio of their Faradaic efficiencies (FEethanol/FEethylene), could be tuned by a factor of up to similar to 12.5. Ethanol formation was maximized on Cu4Zn at -1.05 V vs RHE, with a remarkable Faradaic efficiency and current density of 29.1% and -8.2 mA/cm(2), respectively. The Cu4Zn catalyst was also catalytically stable for the production of ethanol for at least 5 h. The importance of Zn as a CO-producing site was demonstrated by performing CO2 reduction on Cu-Ni and Cu-Ag bimetallic catalysts. Operando Raman spectroscopy revealed that the as-deposited Cu-based oxide films were reduced to the metallic state during CO2 reduction, after which only signals belonging to CO adsorbed on Cu sites were recorded. This showed that the reduction of CO2 probably occurred on metallic sites rather than on metal oxides. A two-site mechanism to rationalize the selective reduction of CO2 to ethanol is proposed and discussed.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.6b02162", "label": [[71, 78, "C2H5OH"], [1262, 1267, "Faradaic efficiency"], [96, 101, "Cu-M"], [1845, 1922, "composite"]]}

However, traditional metal electrodes suffer from higher overpotentials, low activities, and poor selectivity. In this article, the pulse electrodeposition (P-ED) method is employed to prepare a copper electrode for ERC. The P-ED method can easily create Cu coatings on carbon paper with a much rougher surface and extended surface area, which is highly beneficial for improving their activity and selectivity. As a result, the prepared Cu electrodes exhibit high faradaic efficiency (of 85% at -2.8 V) and enhanced partial current density (jCH(4) = 38 mA cm(-2)) for methane, which is by far the highest value ever reported at room temperature and ambient pressure. The enhanced activity is attributed to the extended reactive areas with rough morphology and loosened coating structure to ensure CO2 access the reaction sites located at the sublayers of the deposited Cu coatings. The prominent selectivity for CH4 is likely due to the presence of a stepped surface, which is formed by introduction of Cu (100) step into Cu (111) and Cu (220) terraces during the P-ED processes. The lower resistance to the one-electron transfer to CO2, which is a pre equilibrium step prior to the rate-limiting nonelectrochemical step, is another positive factor to improve the ERC activity for CH4. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that the activity and selectivity of the Cu electrode can be easily recovered through continuous CO2 bubbling.

These catalyst materials appear to be promising for future applications where gaseous CO2 reactants can be transported through the 3D catalyst thereby tuning the mean residence time of reaction intermediates inside the catalyst, which crucially influences the final product distribution. In particular, the annealed skeleton (300 degrees C, 12 h) and the one modified by Cu foam electrodeposition show profound activities toward C-2 product formation (C2H4, C2H6) with faradaic efficiencies reaching FEC2 = 32.3% (annealed skeleton sample, -1.1 V vs RHE) and FEC2 = 29.1% (electrodeposited sample, -1.1 V vs RHE), whereas the electropolished Cu skeleton remains largely inactive for both the C-1 and the C-2 pathway of hydrocarbon formation.

In particular, Cu and Cu-based catalysts have exhibited the capability of converting CO2 into multicarbon fuels and chemicals in significant quantities.

The incorporation of Ag into Cu2O leads to the suppression of hydrogen (H-2) evolution, and furthermore, by varying the elemental arrangement (phase-separated and phase-blended) of Ag and Cu, we observe that C2H5OH selectivity can be controlled. Consequently, the Faradaic efficiency for C2H5OH on phase-blended Ag-Cu2O (Ag-Cu2OPB) is 3 times higher than that of the Cu2O without Ag dopant. We propose that the electrochemical reaction behavior is not solely associated with a role of Ag dopant, carbon monoxide (CO) leading to an ethanol formation pathway over ethylene, but also the doping pattern related population of Ag-Cu biphasic boundaries relatively suppresses the H-2 evolution reaction and encourages the reaction of mobile CO generated on Ag to a residual intermediate on a Cu site.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.7b02822", "label": [[96, 103, "C2H5OH"], [1084, 1091, "M+CuOx"], [25, 45, "structure control"]]}

The initial electrodeposition of dendritic Cu activates the technical supports for highly efficient formate production at low overpotentials (FEFonnate = 49.2% at -0.7 V vs RHE) and in particular for C-C coupling reactions at higher over potentials (FEC2H4 = 34.3% at -1.1 V vs RHE).

Fringe pattern in the HR-TEM analysis confirms the existence of Cu/Cu oxide planes on the corresponding annealed catalysts. IL-SEM and HR-TEM analyses further identify nanodendritic Cu as being the active component for the desired production of multicarbon alcohols. In addition, such nanodendritic Cu shows a remarkably high resistance against degradation with alcohol efficiencies that can be maintained on a high level (FEalcohol = similar to 24% at-1.0 V) over 6 h, whereas the electrodeposited catalyst suffers from a rapid and drastic drop-down in the ethylene efficiency from 33% to 15%.

Modification of electrodeposited copper foam with poly(acrylamide) leads to a significant enhancement in faradaic efficiency for ethylene from 13% (unmodified foam) to 26% at -0.96 V vs RHE, whereas methane yield is unaffected. Effects from crystalline phase distribution and copper oxide phases are ruled out as the source of enhancement through XPS and in situ XRD analysis. DFT calculations reveal that poly(acrylamide) adsorbs on the copper surface via the oxygen atom on the carbonyl groups and enhances ethylene formation by (i) charge donation to the copper surface that activates CO for dimerization, (ii) chemical stabilization of the CO dimer (a key intermediate for C-2 products) by hydrogen-bond interactions with the -NH2 group, and (iii) facilitating the adsorption of CO molecules near the polymer, increasing local surface coverage. Poly(acrylamide) with copper acts as a multipoint binding catalytic system where the interplay between activation and stabilization of intermediates results in enhanced selectivity toward ethylene formation.

In this work, we demonstrate an atomic design of multiple oxygen vacancy-bound, single-atomic Cu-substituted CeO2 to optimize the CO2 electrocatalytic reduction to CH4. We carried out theoretical calculations to predict that the single-atomic Cu substitution in CeO2(110) surface can stably enrich up to three oxygen vacancies around each Cu site, yielding a highly effective catalytic center for CO2 adsorption and activation. This theoretical prediction is consistent with our controlled synthesis of the Cu-doped, mesoporous CeO2 nanorods. Structural characterizations indicate that the low concentration (<5%) Cu species in CeO2 nanorods are highly dispersed at single-atomic level with an unconventionally low coordination number similar to 5, suggesting the direct association of 3 oxygen vacancies with each Cu ion on surfaces.

In this work, copper-nanowire-supported indium catalysts are proposed as advanced electrocatalysts for the aqueous electroreduction of CO2.

The characterization results combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the interface of Cu and In plays an essential role in determining the reaction pathway.

Herein, we describe a surface -electrochemical synthetic strategy to tune the electrochemical CO2 reduction selectivity and yield by controlled suppression of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reaction channel, resulting in increased Faradaic efficiencies for fuels and chemicals. We demonstrate that bimetallic catalysts consisting of only minute submonolayer amounts of Pb adatoms deposited on Cu surfaces exhibit and maintain unusually high selectivities for formate (HCOO-) over a large range of overpotentials. The bimetallic adatom electrodes were prepared using under potential electrodeposition (UPD), which is able to precisely control the adatom coverage. While as little as 0.16 ML Pb surface adatoms on a polycrystalline Cu surface boosted the observed Faradaic HCOO- product selectivity 15 times, the 0.78 ML Pb/Cu catalyst showed the most favorable ratio of HCOO-/H-2 production rate thanks to the effective suppression of the HER combined with a partial (-1.0 to 1.1 V vs RHE) enhancement of the HCOO- production. We argue that the favorable product efficiency is caused by selective adatom poisoning on the strongest binding hydrogen adsorption sites; in addition, electronic effects of Pb adatoms change the chemisorption of reactive intermediates.

In the early stages of the reaction pathway, a selectivity-determining step dictates if the pathway leads to formate (a dead-end) or to CO (and on to multi-carbon products). Therefore, controlling the adsorption of key intermediates, in order to steer the reaction pathway as desired, is critical for selective CO2 electroreduction. Alloying copper is a strategy in which the composition and electronic properties of the alloy surface can be finely tuned to alter the reaction intermediate adsorption behavior. Herein, through in situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we investigate a composition-dependent selectivity toward CO and formate during CO2 electroreduction on a range of Cu-Sn alloy catalysts. We find that the selectivity shifts from CO to formate generation as the Sn content in the alloy catalyst increases because of a shift in adsorption preference from the C-bound *COOH intermediate to the O-bound *OCHO intermediate. Theoretical DFT calculation results indicate that this selectivity shift is due to a gradual weakening of *COOH adsorption and strengthening of *OCHO that occurs with increasing Sn content. A combination of theoretical Bader charge analysis and experimental X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the origin of such transformation: upon alloying, charge is redistributed from Sn to Cu, which creates regions of localized positive charge on the Sn sites. Therefore, with increasing tin content, these localized positive sites hinder the nucleophilic attack of the CO2 carbon, making *COOH adsorption (and the CO pathway) less favorable.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.9b02312", "label": [[110, 116, "alloy"], [966, 973, "HCOOH"], [1016, 1021, "Cu-M"]]}

However, the energy efficiency of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is seriously limited by both poor electrocatalyst with insufficient activity, selectivity, and stability and ineffective electrochemical reactors. In this work, the electroreduction of CO2 to CO is highly improved by the design of copper-metal-organic-frameworks-derived nanoparticle (Cu-MOF/NP) catalysts, in which Cu/Cu2O particles form a porous octahedral structure containing tunable Cu-0 and Cu+ catalytic active sites. The ECR-CO2 can be realized with a high current density of 25.15 mA cm(-2) at a very low applied potential of mere 0.79 V-RHE even in an H-type cell, owing to the high-surface-area porous structure with optimal surface chemistry of exposed Cu cations. Notably, a new flow electrochemical reactor integrated with a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is designed to not only largely reduce the applied potential (similar to 200 mV) but also prompt the sensitivity of the reactor for identifying and quantifying reaction products.

Here, we demonstrate substitution of Cu with an isomorphic atom, i.e., Ni, in CuO and utilize it for improving the hydrocarbon selectivity by 4 times as compared to that of pristine CuO. Hydrocarbon formation is achieved at the lowest possible applied potential (-0.2 V, reversible hydrogen electrode). This gives the overpotential of about 0.37 V for methane and 0.28 V for ethylene, the lowest ever reported. Employing the ionic interaction between Ni and Cu, this catalyst suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction to improve the hydrocarbon selectivity prominently. It is observed that current normalized by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area gives 15-20 times enhancement in the case of Ni-substituted CuO compared to undoped CuO. The in situ experiments indicate that Ni-doped CuO prefers CO pathways compared to formate, resulting into high hydrocarbon selectivity. The experimental observation is further supported by density functional theory studies, which reveal that the Ni-doped CuO catalyst has a higher limiting potential for CO, electroreduction to CH4 due to the stabilization of the CH2O intermediate on the Cu0.9375Ni0.0625O surface rather than the CHO intermediate, in comparison to the pristine CuO surface.\nDoi:10.1021_acssuschemeng.9b05087", "label": [[130, 142, "CuOx"], [432, 493, "surface/interface modification"], [764, 772, "CH4"]]}

The simplest hydrocarbon target is methane, which can utilize existing infrastructure for natural gas storage, distribution, and consumption. Electrochemical methods for methanizing CO2 currently suffer from a combination of low activities and poor selectivities. We demonstrate that copper nanoparticles supported on glassy carbon (n-Cu/C) achieve up to 4 times greater methanation current densities compared to high-purity copper foil electrodes. The n-Cu/C electrocatalyst also exhibits an average Faradaic efficiency for methanation of 80% during extended electrolysis, the highest Faradaic efficiency for room-temperature methanation reported to date. We find that the level of copper catalyst loading on the glassy carbon support has an enormous impact on the morphology of the copper under catalytic conditions and the resulting Faradaic efficiency for methane. The improved activity and Faradaic efficiency for methanation involves a mechanism that is distinct from what is generally thought to occur on copper foils. Electrochemical data indicate that the early steps of methanation on n-Cu/C involve a pre-equilibrium one-electron transfer to CO2 to form an adsorbed radical, followed by a rate-limiting non-electrochemical step in which the adsorbed CO2 radical reacts with a second CO2 molecule from solution.

However, a copper catalyst on a carbon-based gas diffusion layer electrode often has poor stability.especially when performing at high current densities.owing to electrolyte flooding caused by the hydrophobicity decrease of the gas diffusion layer during operation.

This hierarchical copper structure endows the CO2 reduction electrode with sufficient hydrophobicity to build a robust gas-liquid-solid triple-phase boundary, which can not only trap more CO2 close to the active copper surface but also effectively resist electrolyte flooding even under high-rate operation. We consequently achieved a high C2+ production rate of 255 +/- 5.7 mA cm(-2) with a 64 +/- 1.4% faradaic efficiency, as well as outstanding operational stability at 300 mA cm(-2) over 45 h in a flow reactor, largely outperforming its wettable copper counterparts.\nDoi:10.1021_jacs.1c01190", "label": [[736, 895, "structure control"], [19, 25, "Cu"], [1076, 1079, "C2+"], [1128, 1139, "Faradaic efficiency"]]}

We compared the CO2RR selectivity of Cu catalysts subjected to either potentiostatic conditions (fixed applied potential of -0.7 V-RHE) or pulsed electrolysis conditions (1 s pulses at oxidative potentials ranging from E-an = 0.6 to 1.5 V-RHE , followed by 1 s pulses at -0.7 V-RHE ) and identified the main parameters responsible for the enhanced product selectivity observed in the latter case.

The morphological reconstruction of the catalyst observed after pulsed electrolysis with E-an = 0.9 V-RHE, including the presence of highly defective interfaces and grain boundaries, was found to play a key role in the enhancement of the C-2 product formation. In turn, pulsed electrolysis with E-an = 1.2 V-RHE caused the consumption of OH - species near the catalyst surface, leading to an OH-poor environment favorable for CH4 production.\nDoi:10.1021_jacs.1c03443", "label": [[1514, 1518, "C2H4"], [29, 32, "Cu"], [1410, 1437, "defect"]]}

Presently Cu is the only metallic electrocatalyst known to reduce CO2 to appreciable amounts of hydrocarbons, but often a wide range of products such as CO2 HCOO-, and H-2 are formed as well. Better catalysts that exhibit high activity and especially high selectivity for specific products are needed. Here a range of bimetallic Cu-Pd catalysts with ordered, disordered, and phase-separated atomic arrangements (Cu-at:Pd-at = 1:1), as well as two additional disordered arrangements (Cu3Pd and CuPd3 with Cu-at:Pd-at = 3:1 and 1:3), are studied to determine key factors needed to achieve high selectivity for C1 or C2 chemicals in CO2 reduction. When compared with the disordered and phase-separated CuPd catalysts, the ordered CuPd catalyst exhibits the highest selectivity for Cl products (>80%). The phase-separated CuPd and Cu3Pd achieve higher selectivity (>60%) for C2 chemicals than CuPd3 and ordered CuPd, which suggests that the probability of dimerization of Cl intermediates is higher on surfaces with neighboring Cu atoms. Based on surface valence band spectra, geometric effects rather than electronic effects seem to be key in determining the selectivity of bimetallic Cu Pd catalysts.

To date, copper has been found to be the most effective catalyst for electrochemically reducing carbon dioxide to products such as methane, ethene, and ethanol. Unfortunately, the current efficiency of the process is limited by competition with the relatively facile hydrogen evolution reaction. Since multi-carbon products are more valuable precursors to chemicals and fuels than methane, there is considerable interest in modifying copper to enhance the multi-carbon product selectivity. Here, we report our investigations of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction over CuAg bimetallic electrodes and surface alloys, which we find to be more selective for the formation of multi-carbon products than pure copper: This selectivity enhancement is a result of the selective suppression of hydrogen evolution, which occurs due to compressive strain induced by the formation of a CuAg surface alloy. Furthermore, we report that these bimetallic electrocatalysts exhibit an unusually high selectivity for the formation of multi-carbon carbonyl-containing products, which we hypothesize to be the consequence of a reduced coverage of adsorbed hydrogen and the reduced oxophilicity of the compressively strained copper.

Here, we prepared two Cu-based electrodes with mixed oxidation states, namely, HQ-Cu (containing Cu, Cu2O, CuO) and AN-Cu (containing Cu, Cu(OH)(2)). We extracted an ultrathin specimen from the electrodes using a focused ion beam to investigate the distribution and evolution of various Cu species by electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. We found that at the steady stage of the CO2RR, the electrodes have all been reduced to Cu-0, regardless of the initial states, suggesting that the high C2+ selectivities are not associated with specific oxidation states of Cu. We verified this conclusion by control experiments in which HQ-Cu and AN-Cu were pretreated to fully reduce oxides/hydroxides to Cu-0, and the pretreated electrodes showed even higher C2+ selectivity compared with their unpretreated counterparts. We observed that the oxide/hydroxide crystals in HQ-Cu and AN-Cu were fragmented into nanosized irregular Cu grains under the applied negative potentials. Such a fragmentation process, which is the consequence of an oxidation-reduction cycle and does not occur in electropolished Cu, not only built an intricate network of grain boundaries but also exposed a variety of high-index facets.

At low overpotentials, the Au/Cu electrocatalyst is over 100 times more selective for the formation of products containing C-C bonds versus methane or methanol, largely favouring the generation of alcohols over hydrocarbons. A combination of electrochemical testing and transport modelling supports the hypothesis that CO2 reduction on gold generates a high CO concentration on nearby copper, where CO is further reduced to alcohols such as ethanol and n-propanol under locally alkaline conditions. The bimetallic Au/Cu electrocatalyst exhibits synergistic activity and selectivity superior to gold, copper or AuCu alloys, and opens new possibilities for the development of CO2 reduction electrodes exploiting tandem catalysis mechanisms.\nDoi:10.1038_s41929-018-0139-9", "label": [[429, 434, "Cu-M"], [988, 1110, "composite"], [46, 49, "C2+"]]}

After initiation of the electrochemical CO2 reduction by these oxide structures, the selectivity of the process was found to largely depend on the parent Cu2O film thickness, rather than on the initial crystal orientation. Starting with thin Cu2O films, besides CO and hydrogen, selective formation of ethylene is observed with very high ethylene-to-methane ratios (similar to 8 to 12). In addition to these products, thicker Cu2O films yield a remarkably large amount of ethane. Long term Faradaic efficiency analysis of hydrocarbons shows no sign of deactivation of the electrodes after 5 hours of continuous experiment. Online mass spectroscopy studies combined with X-ray diffraction data suggest the reduction of the Cu2O films in the presence of CO2, generating a nanoparticulate Cu morphology, prior to the production of hydrogen, CO, and hydrocarbons.

Most recently, modifying the electrodes with phosphate ligands through electrodepositing electrode materials has shown promising results in improving the kinetics of some reactions. However, it is unclear how the presence of phosphate anions affects the electrodeposition process and functions in catalyzing reactions. Here, we report a systematic study on electrodeposition of Cu in the presence of phosphate anions. The phosphate anions form a complex with free Cu(II) cations, competing with the electrodeposition process. The competition between the two processes results in an insufficient supply of free Cu(II) for electrodeposition, especially at the diffusion layer. This is evidenced by the calculation of free Cu(II) concentration and the electrodeposition current at identical applied potentials. We also found that the electrodeposition of Cu in the presence of phosphate generates Cu-oxyo/hydroxyo-phosphate species on the deposited copper surface. The modified electrodes with phosphate species exhibit higher selectivity for HCOOH formation (faradaic efficiency similar to 80%) from the electrochemical reduction of CO2 as compared with Cu foil (faradaic efficiency similar to 33%). The effect of phosphate ligands promoting HCOOH selectivity is further verified by stripping off the ligands and regenerating the ligands.\nDoi:10.1039_c7ta01871a", "label": [[60, 71, "HCOOH"], [1378, 1382, "Faradaic efficiency"], [1253, 1346, "surface/interface modification"], [22, 28, "Cu"]]}

This strategy allows tuning of the selectivity of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and a decrease of the hydrogen evolution rate simultaneously by facilitating the supply of CO2 reactants and inhibiting the adsorption of water (protons). The transferring point from a pinning to bursting state turned out to be the optimized condition leading to the highest CO2RR faradaic efficiency without significant interference of current density. The optimized superaerophilic Cu NW catalyst showed CO-selectivity with a Faraday efficiency of 71% at -0.4 V vs. RHE and HCOOH-selectivity with a Faraday efficiency of 68% at -0.6 V vs. RHE. Moreover, the accelerated gas and ion diffusion and homogenized reactions also avoided accumulative damage on the surface of the Cu NWs and enhanced the stability of the Cu catalyst.

Herein, we demonstrated the synthesis of hollow Au-Cu nanoparticles of size ranging from 50 nm to 100 nm with a wall thickness of 4.95 +/- 0.81 nm for efficient CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) via galvanic replacement and the Kirkendall effect between copper and gold.

To find out how the superior catalytic performance was achieved, hollow Au-Cu NP/C was then annealed in O-2 and N-2. It was found that after being annealed, the catalysts almost totally lost the activity towards CO2RR, which may be due to the partial segregation of Cu species on the nanoparticle surface as well as a decrease in the surface defect density with the improvement in crystallinity. Thus, it was concluded that high dispersion of more Au atoms on the nanoparticle surface together with the presence of more surface defect sites could account for the superior CO2RR performance of the as-synthesized hollow Au-Cu NP/C.\nDoi:10.1039_c8qi00297e", "label": [[25, 30, "Cu-M"], [106, 108, "CO"], [400, 426, "structure control"], [901, 927, "Faradaic efficiency"]]}

However, low-cost, Earth-abundant yet efficient and stable electrocatalysts for composition-adjustable syngas have still not been realized for practical applications. Herein, new hierarchical 0D/2D heterostructures of SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) confined on CuS nanosheets (NSs) were designed to enable CO2 electroreduction to a wide-range syngas (CO/H-2: 0.11-3.86) with high faradaic efficiency (>85%), remarkable turnover frequency (96.12 h(-1)) and excellent durability (over 24 h). Detailed experimental characterization studies together with theoretical calculations manifest that the ascendant catalytic performance is not only attributed to the heterostructure of ultrasmall SnO2 NPs homogeneously confined on ultrathin CuS NSs, which endows the maximum exposure of active sites and faster charge transfer, but is also accounted by the strong interaction between well-defined SnO2 and CuS interfaces, which modulated reaction free-energies of reaction intermediates and hence improved the activity of CO2 electroreduction to highly ratio-tunable syngas.

However, the low reaction rate and efficiency, as well as poor selectivity, have limited its further development. The low solubility of CO2 in an aqueous solution is one of the main factors that limit the reaction rate and selectivity of the electroreduction of CO2 (ERC) at a high overpotential. In this study, an organic additive containing an -NH2 group (methyl carbamate, MC) was incorporated into the ERC electrolyte for the first time. By utilizing the affinity interaction between a Lewis acid (the -NH3+ group formed by protonation of the -NH2 group) and a Lewis base (CO2), the ERC reaction rate was increased by 17%, and the faradaic efficiency for the production of CH4 reached 81.6%, which represented a large increase of 34% and surpassed that of most reported Cu electrodes. Furthermore, the partial current density for the production of CH4 was 31 mA cm(-2) at -2.13 V (vs. RHE), which represents an increase of 30% in comparison with that in the blank system. In addition, the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction was substantially inhibited, and the decline in faradaic efficiency increased from 38.5% to 48.1% when the potential decreased gradually from -1.63 V to -1.98 V (vs. RHE). DFT calculations further indicate that the -NH3+ group can significantly promote the adsorption of CO* and CHO* on the Cu surface and increase the surface coverage of both intermediates. CHO* can be further stabilized by the -NH3+ group via the facilitation of partial electron transfer from Cu to C and the formation of H-bonds, which is favorable for further hydrogenation to form hydrocarbons. These results provide a simple and powerful way to increase the reaction rate and product selectivity of the reduction of CO2.\nDoi:10.1039_c9ta00039a", "label": [[958, 961, "CH4"], [970, 975, "Faradaic efficiency"], [50, 53, "Cu"], [593, 702, "surface/interface modification"]]}

Furthermore, a 23 cm long nanoporous AuCu3@Au bulk electrode with good ductility was prepared, over which the active current reached up to 37.2 mA with a current density of 10.78 mA cm(-2) at -0.7 V vs. RHE, pushing the reduction of CO2 to industrialization. The unsaturated coordination environment with a coordination number of 8.2 over the shell gold and curved interface determined this high electrocatalytic performance.

The density of states indicates that the introduction of Cu causes the d-band-centre of AuCu3@Au to move toward the Fermi level, directly bonding with *COOH.

Different Ni thicknesses on Cu2O were achieved by varying the time of chronopotentiometric deposition of Ni. Electrochemical CO2 reduction was carried out at -0.89 V and -1.89 V vs. RHE, and it was found that formate and CO were the two major products. Cu2O modified with a Ni overlayer with a thickness of similar to 700 nm resulted in the highest formate faradaic efficiency of 18%, and Cu2O resulted in highest CO faradaic efficiency of 7.9%. The enhanced faradaic efficiency for formate is attributed to the synergistic effect between Ni and Cu2O due to maximized amounts of exposed bimetallic sites that facilitate CO2 reduction. The electrocatalyst also produces similar to 9 times more current density than previous studies using Ni-Cu2O electrocatalysts for the OER. The ability of the Ni-Cu2O thin films to catalyze both the OER and CO2 reduction allows them to be incorporated in the first demonstration of a two-electrode CO2 conversion device with a bifunctional catalyst.

A dynamic hydrogen bubble template approach is applied to electrodeposit a binary PdCu alloy foam yielding a nominal bulk composition of 9 at% Pd and 91 at% Cu (denoted as Pd9Cu91). The material is further modified by means of thermal annealing (12 h at 200 degrees C in air), which completely transforms the as-prepared metallic Pd(9)Cu(91)alloy foam into its oxidic state. The ultimate catalyst activation is achieved by subsequent reduction (at -0.65 Vvs.RHE for 45 min) of the oxidic precursors (composite of Cu2O, CuO, and CuPdO3) into metallic state, as indicated byoperandoRaman spectroscopy. Identical location scanning electron microscopy (IL-SEM) analysis, carried out prior to and after the activation treatments, demonstrates significant morphological alterations of the Pd(9)Cu(91)foam on the nm length scale, which go along with a phase segregation into nm-range Pd-rich and Cu-rich domains that helps to increase the PrOH selectivity. Time-dependent ICP-MS analyses of the electrolyte solution, carried out during the catalyst activation, demonstrate preferential (rapid) Cu dissolution followed by (slow) Cu redeposition on the catalyst surface. These processes are found to be superimposed on the actual oxide reduction. A two-fold selectivity of PrOH was observed over ethanol (EtOH). The excellent long-term stability of the activated Pd(9)Cu(91)foam catalyst is rationalized by the full suppression of the C1 hydrocarbon (methane) pathway.

Here, we colloidally synthesized metallic copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution (<10%) and utilized them in electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions. Monometallic Cu and Ag nanoparticle electrodes showed severe nanoparticle sintering already at low overpotential of -0.8 V vs. RHE, as evidenced by ex situ SEM investigations, and potential-dependent variations in product selectivity that resemble bulk Cu (14% for ethylene at -1.3 V vs. RHE) and Ag (69% for carbon monoxide at -1.0 V vs. RHE). However, by co-deposition of Cu and Ag nanoparticles, a nanoparticle stabilization effect was observed between Cu and Ag, and the sintering process was greatly suppressed at CO2 reducing potentials (-0.8 V vs. RHE). Furthermore, by varying the Cu/Ag nanoparticle ratio, the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) selectivity towards methane (maximum of 20.6% for dense Cu-2.5-Ag-1 electrodes) and C-2 products (maximum of 15.7% for dense Cu-1-Ag-1 electrodes) can be tuned, which is attributed to a synergistic effect between neighbouring Ag and Cu nanoparticles. We attribute the stabilization of the nanoparticles to the positive enthalpies of Cu-Ag solid solutions, which prevents the dissolution-redeposition induced particle growth under CO2RR conditions. The observed nanoparticle stabilization effect enables the design and fabrication of active CO2 reduction nanocatalysts with high durability.\nDoi:10.1039_d0nr09040a", "label": [[31, 70, "Cu-M"], [559, 648, "structure control"], [1381, 1389, "CH4"]]}

Copper-based catalysts play an important role in the field of electrocatalytic CO2 because of their ability to reduce CO2 to hydrocarbons. However, problems such as high overpotential, catalyst deactivation, and uncontrollable product selectivity limit their further development.

It is found that Ag/Cu composite structures are more active for the reduction of CO2 to C2H4, compared to those of Zn modified. The faradaic efficiency of CO2 reduction to ethylene reaches 41.3% and it remains stable for more than 8 hours. Theoretical calculations show that the modification of silver regulates the electronic structure of highly porous copper at the Cu/Ag interface, accelerates the process of carbon dioxide reduction of the first electron, enhances the adsorption of *CO and further facilitates *CO dimerization to ethylene.

As a CO2 reduction catalyst, the hierarchically nanoporous copper integrated with vanadium oxide can achieve a 30.1% faradaic efficiency for CO2-to-ethanol production and an ethanol partial current density of -16 mA cm(-2) at -0.62 V vs. RHE, corresponding to a 4-fold increase in activity compared to bare nanoporous Cu.

However, different morphologies and structures of TiO2 supports can be obtained through various methods, leading to the discrepant electrocatalytic properties of CuO/TiO2. In this paper, three supports, named dense TiO2, TiO2 nanotube and TiO2 nanofiber, were applied to synthesize CuO/TiO2 electrodes by thermal decomposition, and the performances of the electrocatalysts were studied. Results show that the main product of the three electrocatalysts was ethanol, but the electrochemical efficiency and reaction characteristics are obviously different. The liquid product of CuO/Dense TiO2 is pure ethanol, however, the current efficiency is rather low owing to the higher resistance of the TiO2 film. CuO/TiO2 nanotube shows high conductivity and ethanol can be synthesized at low overpotential with high current efficiency, but the gas products cannot be restricted. CuO/TiO2 nanofiber has a larger specific surface area and more active sites, which is beneficial for CO2 reduction, and the hydrogen evolution reaction can be evidently restricted.

Bimetallic combinations of Cu with other metals have been investigated with the goal of steering selectivity via creating a tandem pathway through the CO intermediate or by changing the surface electronic structure. Here, we demonstrate a facile cation exchange method to synthesize Ag/Cu electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction using Cu sulfides as a growth template. Beginning with Cu2-xS nanosheets (C-nano-0, 100 nm lateral dimension, 14 nm thick), varying the Ag+ concentration in the exchange solution produces a gradual change in crystal structure from Cu7S4 to Ag2S, as the Ag/Cu mass ratio varies from 0.3 to 25 (CA-nano-x, x indicating increasing Ag fraction). After cation exchange, the nanosheet morphology remains but with increased shape distortion as the Ag fraction is increased. Interestingly, the control (C-nano-0) and cation exchanged nanosheets have very high faradaic efficiency for producing formate at low overpotential (-0.2 V vs. RHE). The primary effect of Ag incorporation is increased production of C2+ products at -1.0 V vs. RHE compared with C-nano-0, which primarily produces formate. Cation exchange can also be used to modify the surface of Cu foils. A two-step electro-oxidation/sulfurization process was used to form Cu sulfides on Cu foil (C-foil-x) to a depth of a few 10 s of microns. With lower Ag+ concentrations, cation exchange produces uniformly dispersed Ag; however, at higher concentrations, Ag particles nucleate on the surface. During CO2 electroreduction testing, the product distribution for Ag/Cu sulfides on Cu foil (CA-foil-x-y) changes in time with an initial increase in ethylene and methane production followed by a decrease as more H-2 is produced. The catalysts undergo a morphology evolution towards a nest-like structure which could be responsible for the change in selectivity. For cation-exchanged nanosheets (CA-nano-x), pre-reduction at negative potentials increases the CO2 reduction selectivity compared to tests of as-synthesized material, although this led to the aggregation of nanosheets into filaments. Both types of bimetallic catalysts are capable of selective reduction of CO2 to multi-carbon products, although the optimal configurations appear to be metastable.\nDoi:10.1039_d1ra03811g", "label": [[1166, 1174, "HCOOH"], [586, 597, "CuSx"], [634, 702, "structure control"]]}

Ultraviolet-ozone pre-treatment of Cu nanoparticles reduced the density of TDP. Desorption of the remaining ligands was expedited within 3 h of the CO2 reduction process, and the concurrent aggregation of NPs formed bare Cu clusters. The increased C2+ selectivity of >50% faradaic efficiency revealed that the existing grain boundaries of Cu clusters promoted CO dimerization to produce C2+ materials. Despite similar cluster formation, Cu nanoparticles without ultraviolet-ozone treatment showed poor C2+ selectivity, suggesting that the remaining TDP, half of the original concentration, passivated the grain boundaries.

The aim of the present work is to evaluate the continuous gas-phase CO2 electroreduction to hydrocarbons (i.e. ethylene and methane) at copper nanoparticulated-based surfaces, paying attention to particle size influence (ranging from 25-80 nm) on reaction productivity, selectivity, and Faraday efficiency (FE) for CO2 conversion. The effect of the current density and the presence of a microporous layer within the working electrode are then evaluated. Copper-based gas diffusion electrodes are prepared by airbrushing the catalytic ink onto carbon supports, which are then coupled to a cation exchange membrane (Nafion) in a membrane electrode assembly. The results show that the use of smaller copper nanoparticles (25 nm) leads to a higher ethylene production (1148 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) with a remarkable high FE (92.8%), at the same time, diminishing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction in terms of FE.

Cu2O and CuO NPs in Cu/Pyr-GDY can be electrochemically reduced to cubic metallic CuNPs to get Cu/Pyr-GDY-R electrocatalyst, with the average size of metallic Cu NPs being 42 nm. The Cu/Pyr-GDY-R on Cu foil can be directly used as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for CO2-to-formate conversion in a CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte, with a formate Faradaic efficiency (FEformate) as high as 95% (at -1.2 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode), far superior to that of Pyr-GDY-free Cu NPs (with a FEformate of only 29%). The key reaction intermediate of HCOO* during CO2-to-formate conversion was identified by in situ Raman spectroscopy. The results of density functional theory calculations revealed that the Pyr-GDY support can decrease the reaction free energy for the adsorption of HCOO* on Cu site, due to the electron transfer from metallic Cu NPs to conjugated diacetylene groups in 2D Pyr-GDY support, which leads to the high selectivity for formate over hydrogen production.\nDoi:10.1088_2053-1583_ac217b", "label": [[7, 42, "Cu/C"], [91, 98, "HCOOH"], [989, 1037, "Faradaic efficiency"], [297, 347, "composite"]]}

The found reactivity pattern was then also transferred to the CO reduction reaction (CORR) under benchmark conditions yielding additional insights. The results suggest that at high current density/high overpotential conditions, also other ethene formation pathways apart from acetaldehyde reduction such as CH2 dimerization are present. A new suggestion for a high current density mechanism will be presented, which is in agreement with the experimental observations and the found activity pattern of copper cathodes toward organic functional group conversion.\nDoi:10.3390_catal7050161", "label": [[989, 995, "C2H4"], [956, 959, "Faradaic efficiency"], [626, 632, "Cu"], [610, 626, "structure control"]]}

Herein, a core-shell xZnO@yCu(2)O catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction was fabricated via a two-step route. The high selectivity of C-2 products of 49.8% on ZnO@4Cu(2)O (ethylene 33.5%, ethanol 16.3%) with an excellent total current density of 140.1 mA cm(-2) was achieved over this core-shell structure catalyst in a flow cell, in which the C-2 selectivity was twice that of Cu2O. The high electrochemical activity for ECR to C-2 products was attributed to the synergetic effects of the ZnO core and Cu2O shell, which not only enhanced the selectivity of the coordinating electron, improved the HER overpotential, and fastened the electron transfer, but also promoted the multielectron involved kinetics for ethylene and ethanol production.

Notably, in comparison with the control electrode (Cu/SnO2) without undergoing annealing step, A-Cu/SnO2 exhibits a significant enhancement in terms of CO2 reduction activity and CO selectivity. By investigating the effect of the amount of the electrodeposited SnO2, it is found that A-Cu/SnO2 electrodes present the characteristic Sn-Cu synergistic catalysis with a feature of dominant CO formation (CO faradaic efficiency, 7075%), the least HCOOH formation (HCOOH faradaic efficiency, <5%) and the remarkable inhibition of hydrogen evolution reaction. In contrast, Cu/SnO2 electrodes exhibit a SnO2 coverage-dependent catalysisa shift from CO selectivity to HCOOH selectivity with the increasing deposited SnO2 on Cu foam. The different catalytic performance between Cu/SnO2 and A-Cu/SnO2 might be attributed to the different content of Cu atoms in SnO2 layer, which may affect the density of Cu-Sn interface on the surface.

Herein, we describe a novel preparation method for carbon-doped copper oxide catalysts based on an oxidative thermal treatment of copper-containing deep eutectic solvents (DES). XRD and EDX analysis of the samples show that thermal treatment at 500 degrees C in air for a prolonged time (60 min) provides exclusively carbon-doped copper(II) oxide catalysts, whereas shorter calcination time leads to a mixture of less oxidized forms of copper (Cu2O and Cu-0), CuO, and a higher carbon content from the DES. Chronoamperometry of the electrode containing the prepared materials in 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte show the reduction of CuO to less oxidized copper species. The materials prepared by the use of different DES, copper precursors and calcination times were used as electrocatalysts for the electrochemical CO2 reduction. Chemical analysis of the products reveals an enhanced selectivity toward C2 and C3 products for the catalyst prepared from the DES galactose-urea with copper nanoparticles and calcination for 60 min in air.

To remove template molecules and to sinter the copper particles, the time of calcination was varied in a range of 1-4 h at 600 degrees C. This calcination temperature was determined based on Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), showing completion of hydrocarbon removal at this temperature.

Temperature programmed reduction experiments (TPR) were used to analyze the hydrogen treatment. The Faradaic Efficiency (FE) towards CO in electrochemical reduction of CO2 was determined at -0.45 V vs. RHE (Reversible Hydrogen Electrode), using a 0.3 M KHCO3 electrolyte. A calcination time of 3 h at 600 degrees C and a hydrogen treatment temperature of 280 degrees C were found to induce the highest FE to CO of 73% at these constant electrochemical conditions.

It is known that the preparation of efficient catalysts for this transformation is the key factor that determines the yield of C2H4. In this study, we prepared 1-octyl-3-methylimidazole functionalized graphite sheets (ILGS) in a facile manner by the electro-exfoliation of pure graphite rod in an aqueous solution of 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (OmimCl : H2O = 1 : 5, V/V) at 10 V. They were then dispersed in an aqueous solution of copper chloride and sodium citrate. Subsequent reduction with sodium borohydride led to the formation of a composite comprised of cuprous oxide supported on Omimfunctionalized graphite sheets (Cu2O/ILGS). This composite was found to be an efficient catalyst for the electroreduction of carbon dioxide to ethylene. The as-made materials were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The TEM images showed that the ILGS were composed of multiple layers of graphene. The XRD pattern and Raman spectrum indicated that the surface of the ILGS possessed several defects. In the electro-exfoliation process, the defects in the ILGS were modified in situ by covalent bonding with Omim groups, which was also confirmed by XPS. The Cu2O nanoparticles with an average diameter of 5 nm were uniformly distributed on the surface of the ILGS because the Omim groups grafted to the graphite sheets acted as anchors and prevented their aggregation by the steric effect. The electrocatalytic activities of Cu2O/ILGS for CO2 reduction were measured at different voltages in 0.1 mol L-1 KHCO3 aqueous solution under ambient temperature and pressure. These experiments showed that the catalytic performance of the Cu2O/ILGS composite was determined by cuprous oxide, while the ILGS displayed nearly no catalytic activity in the electroreduction of carbon dioxide. The faradaic efficiency of hydrogen and carbon dioxide reduction products changed with the reaction time because of the reduction of Cu2O to Cu under the electroreduction conditions.

However, the use of traditional fossil energy leads to high amounts of carbon dioxide emissions, causing severe greenhouse effects. This, in turn, triggers a series of environmental problems. Harnessing renewable energy such as solar energy, wind energy, and hydropower to replace the traditional energy sources is very urgent. Conversion CO2 into value-added fuels and chemicals could be a useful strategy to mitigate the current energy and environmental crisis. It is well known that Cu-based materials are good electrocatalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (ECR-CO2). However, they suffer from some disadvantages such as high overpotential and poor selectivity and durability. Therefore, the development of copper based electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity is essential. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials that have the advantages of large specific surface area, tunable pore size and porosity, and highly dispersed unsaturated metal centers can be used as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction or as precursors for further preparation of catalysts with excellent performance. Through thermal decomposition in an inert atmosphere, metal ions in MOF can be transformed into metal clusters, metal oxides, or even metal mono-atoms. Meanwhile, organic ligands are carbonized into porous carbon materials. The addition of some heteroatoms such as B, N, P, and S to carbon materials has also been shown to be effective in changing the electron state and coordination structure of the catalysts. These heteroatoms combine with carbon atoms to form a new active site, denoted as M-X-C (M is the central metal ion and X is the mixed heteroatom) to enhance the catalytic activity of the ECR-CO2. Herein, pre-synthesized Cu-NBDC MOF (a Cu-based MOF synthesized by using 2-aminoterephthalic acid (NBDC) as ligand) is used as a precursor to anchor Cu2O/Cu on nitrogen doped porous carbon (Cu2O/Cu@NC) by annealing at different temperatures. XPS analysis shows that the Cu-N content in Cu2O/Cu@NC decreases with increasing annealing temperature. Investigation of the ECR-CO2 reveals that Cu2O/Cu@NC can inhibit the HER more effectively compared to Cu2O/Cu@C, thereby improving the overall catalytic activity and multi-electron product selectivity of the ECR-CO2. While the Faradic efficiency of formate (FEformate) increases with increasing temperature, those of ethylene and methane (FEC2H4 and FECH4, respectively) decreases with increasing temperature. Specifically, upon annealing at 400 degrees C, the CO2 Faradic efficiency of Cu2O/Cu@NC-400 is higher than 86% (-1.4 to -1.6 V vs. RHE), including 20.4% of FEC2H4 (-1.4 V vs. RHE) and 23.9% of FECH4 (-1.6 V vs. RHE). By contrast, FECH4 (-1.6 V vs. RHE) in the presence of Cu2O/Cu@C-400 without nitrogen doping is only 2.33%, and no C2H4 is detected. These significant differences in the catalytic behavior can be attributed to the fact that Cu-N is conducive for the stable adsorption of the *CH2 intermediate during the ECR-CO2, inhibiting the evolution of H-2.

As an ECR product, ethylene (C2H4) has a higher energy density than do C-1 species and is an important industrial feedstock in high demand. However, the conversion of CO2 to C2H4 is plagued by low productivity and large overpotential, in addition to the severe competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during the ECR. To address these issues, the design and development of advanced electrocatalysts are critical. Here, we demonstrate fine-tuning of ECR to C(2)H(4 )by taking advantage of the prominent interaction of Cu with shape-controlled CeO2 nanocrystals, that is, cubes, rods, and octahedra predominantly covered with (100), (110), and (111) surfaces, respectively. We found that the selectivity and activity of the ECR depended strongly on the exposed crystal facets of CeO2. The overall ECR Faradaic efficiency (FE) over Cu/CeO2(110) (FE approximate to 56.7%) surpassed that of both Cu/CeO2(100) (FE approximate to 51.5%) and Cu/CeO2(111) (FE approximate to 48.4%) in 0.1 mol.L--(1) KHCO3 solutions with an H-type cell. This was in stark contrast to the exclusive occurrence of the HER over pure carbon paper, CeO2(100), CeO2(110), and CeO2(111). In particular, the FE toward C2H4 formation and the partial current density increased in the sequence Cu/CeO2(111) < Cu/CeO2(100) < Cu/CeO2(110) within applied bias potentials from -1.00 to -1.15 V (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode), reaching 39.1% over Cu/CeO2(110) at a mild overpotential (1.13 V). The corresponding values for Cu/CeO2(100) and Cu/CeO2(111) were FEC2H4 approximate to 31.8% and FEC2H4 approximate to 29.6%, respectively. The C2H4 selectivity was comparable to that of many reported Cu-based electrocatalysts at similar overpotentials. Furthermore, the FE for C2H4 remained stable even after 6 h of continuous electrolysis. The superior ECR activity of Cu/CeO2(110) to yield C2H4 was attributed to the metastable (110) surface, which not only promoted the effective adsorption of CO2 but also remarkably stabilized Cu+, thereby boosting the ECR to produce C2H4. This work offers an alternative strategy to enhance the ECR efficiency by crystal facet engineering.\nDoi:10.3866_PKU.WHXB202009023", "label": [[40, 49, "C2H4"], [54, 85, "Cu-MOx"], [2226, 2231, "Faradaic efficiency"], [87, 119, "structure control"]]}

This work demonstrates that the high activity and selectivity of Cu to C2+ products can be achieved by atomic-scale spacings between two facets of Cu particles. These spacings are created by lithiating CuOx particles, removing lithium oxides formed, and electrochemically reducing CuOx to metallic Cu. Also, the range of spacing (d(s)) is confirmed via the 3D tomographs using the Cs-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (3D tomo-STEM), and the operando X-ray absorption spectra show that oxidized Cu reduces to the metallic state during the CO2RR. Moreover, control of d(s) to 5-6 angstrom allows a current density exceeding that of unmodified CuOx nanoparticles by about 12 folds and a Faradaic efficiency of approximate to 80% to C2+. Density functional theory calculations support that d(s) of 5-6 angstrom maximizes the binding energies of CO2 reduction intermediates and promotes C-C coupling reactions.

Herein, a Cu(3)Ag(1)electrocatalyst is developed using galvanic replacement of an electrodeposited Cu matrix.

Many efforts have been devoted to boost the activity and selectivity of high-value multicarbon products (C2+) on Cu-based electrocatalysts. However, Cu-based CO2RR electrocatalysts suffer from poor catalytic stability mainly due to the structural degradation and loss of active species under CO2RR condition.

Copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) are exceptionally advantageous for CO2RR to yield multielectron transfer chemical products such as ethylene and ethanol.

Here, the oxidation/reduction process is examined in detail. It is found that the faradaic efficiencies for both ethylene and ethanol are enhanced after oxidation/reduction cycling in the presence of halide anions. Specifically, cycling of the electrode in the presence of chloride, bromide, or fluoride anions allows for an ethylene faradaic efficiency of approximately 15.2 %, a factor of 1.5 higher than that for polycrystalline copper (at -1.0 V vs. RHE). The faradaic efficiency for ethanol is also enhanced from 2.65 to approximately 7.6 %. The effects of electrochemical oxidation/reduction with the chloride anion were investigated by using in situ Raman spectroscopy, and the changes in the surface morphology of copper were monitored by using SEM. Consistent with prior reports, it is observed that during the oxidation part of the cycle, anodic corrosion forms a Cu2O layer, which consists of cubical crystals of about 150 nm. During the reduction sweep, it is converted to metallic copper, which forms irregular Cu nanoparticles of around 20 nm in diameter. The enhancement in ethylene formation is presumably attributed to the formation of grain boundaries, which may serve as active sites.\nDoi:10.1002_celc.201600068", "label": [[109, 115, "Cu"], [635, 644, "C2H4"], [681, 687, "Faradaic efficiency"], [1379, 1480, "structure control"]]}

Tandem catalysis for CO2 reduction is an efficient strategy to overcome such problems. Here, Cu@Ag core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) with different silver layer thicknesses are fabricated to realize the tandem catalysis for CO2 conversion by producing CO on Ag shell and further achieving C-C coupling on Cu core.

Moreover, it exhibits remarkably electrocatalytic stability after 14 h. Based on electrochemical tests and CO adsorption capacity analyses, the origin of the enhanced catalytic performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect between Ag shell and Cu core, which strengthens the bonding strength of CO on Cu/Ag interfaces, expedites the charge transfer, increases the electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs).

In order to solve the poisoning species problem, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 was carried out using a copper electrode in the pulse electrolysis mode by anodic as well as cathodic polarization.

Significant progress has been achieved via CO2 gas diffusion electrolysis, to react at high selectivity and high rate. However, the gas diffusion layer (GDL) of the gas diffusion electrode (GDE) still suffers from low tolerance and limited active sites. Here, the hydrophobic 1-octadecanethiol molecular was functionalized over the Cu catalyst layer of the GDE, which simultaneously stabilizes the GDL and exposes abundant active solid-liquid-gas three-phase interfaces. The resultant GDE exhibits multi-carbon (C2+) product selectivity over faradaic efficiency (FE) of 70.0% in the range of 100 to 800 mA.cm(-2), with the peak FEC2+ of 85.2% at 800 mA.cm(-2).

The alloy electrode surfaces provided good selectivity and efficiency in electrochemical CO2 conversion because they provided appropriate binding energies between the metal and the reactive species obtained through CO2 reduction. Therefore, product selectivity can be modulated by altering the Cu-Sn crystal structure of the electrode. Using the Cu-Sn alloy electrodes, electrochemical reduction was performed at applied potentials ranging from - 0.69 to - 1.09 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). During electrochemical CO2 reduction, all the prepared Cu-Sn alloy electrodes showed prominent suppression of hydrogen evolution.

We found that, in electrolytic CO2 reduction using an electrolytically plated Cu-Co electrode, a hydrocarbon product with high faradaic efficiency (FE) could be obtained with low-FE CO. The plated electrodes have a Co solid solution on the Cu surface. The non-localized Co changes the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediate in CO2 reduction.

Further, in electrolytic CO2 reduction with an applied potential of -1.19V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the selectivity of methane (CH4) production improved, while the selectivity of ethylene (C2H4) formation lowered. In the reduction using the plated electrode containing 14% Co, the FE of CH4 production reached the highest at 47.7%.

The small-overpotential pathway deactivates the electrodes, while the large-overpotential pathway does not.

Hence, the *COH-based coking pathway opens first until the potential is negative enough for the *CHO-based pathway to dominate.

Besides, the 20-g + samples can be readily fabricated in one batch and exhibit the almost identical CO2RR performances. Furthermore, the combined experimental and theoretical calculation results identify the genuine active Cu-N-4 sites are responsible for the high selectivity and efficiency of CO production.

These deposits were characterized by X-ray diffraction and they vary in their crystal orientation. Pure Cu and Cu/Cu were aligned towards (111) and (220) plane with a texture coefficient of 1.2 and 1.7, respectively. Electrodeposited electrodes were tested for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in KCl electrolyte and the results were compared with that of pure Cu electrode. Electrochemical reduction of CO2 showed methane and ethane, with hydrogen as the byproduct. The product distribution varied with the crystal orientation of Cu electrodes. The maximum Faradaic efficiency of methane was 26% obtained on pure Cu electrode with (111) and (200) orientation, whereas Cu/Cu-L with dominating (220) orientation showed a maximum formation of ethane with Faradaic efficiency of 43%.

Selective formation of C-2 over the C-1 products, however, is a formidable challenge on all electrocatalysts known in literature. Here, we report the selectivity of CuO-derived porous copper nanoribbon arrays as the electrode to convert CO2 to C-2 products. The C-C bond coupling occurred at electrode potentials <-0.701 V vs. RHE. The total Faradaic efficiency towards the formation of these C-2 compounds (C2H4, C2H6 and C2H5OH) reached to similar to 40% at -0.816 V vs. RHE under ambient pressure and temperature. More importantly, at the same condition, the total Faradaic efficiency for C-1 products (CO and HCOO-) was <3%, which were major products when a Cu2O-derived Cu electrode was used. Methane was not observed, a key product on a Cu foil electrode. This increased selectivity towards the formation of C-2 chemicals, meanwhile suppressed C-1 chemicals, are attributed to the presence of surface defects and a large number of grain boundaries on the CuO-derived porous Cu nanoribbon arrays electrode. Moreover, the activation of CO2 was found to likely occur at the copper surface; while the presence of copper oxide layer reported in literature may result from the interaction between copper and water during the post analysis process.

Cu/SWNT, Cu/RGO and Cu/OLC composite catalysts are synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, transmission electron microscopy and electrochemical surface area measurements. Electrocatalytic activities of the synthesized materials, as measured in an electrochemical cell connected to a gas chromatograph, are compared to that of Cu NPs supported on Vulcan carbon. All four catalysts demonstrate higher activity towards C2H4 generation vs CH4, with production of the latter mostly suppressed on Cu NPs supported on nanostructured substrates. Onset potentials for C2H4 vs CH4 generation demonstrate 200 mV positive shifts for Cu/SWNT, Cu/RGO, and Cu/OLC catalysts. The Cu/OLC catalyst is found to be superior to the other two nanostructured catalysts in terms of stability, activity and selectivity towards C2H4 generation. Its faradaic efficiency reached 60% at -1.8 V vs Ag/AgCl. The enhanced stability and activity of the Cu/OLC catalyst can be attributed to the unique catalyst design, wherein a shell of OLC surrounds the Cu NPs. Such a configuration enables the outer layer to act as a filter that protects the Cu surface from adsorption of undesirable species, enhances its electrocatalytic performance, and improves its viability in CO2 electroreduction reaction. The enhanced selectivity of the Cu/OLC catalyst towards the C2H4 production is most likely related to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the OLC support towards the CO2 electroreduction to CO. Higher CO surface concentration from CO2 electroreduction on the OLC support, rather than a greater number of available sites for CO dimerization, likely originated this behavior. CO molecules generate on surfaces of OLCs, dimerize on Cu NP (100) planes, and, subsequently, yield additional C2H4 molecules. Both the reduction of the CO2 to CO on the surface of OLCs and reduction of \"extra\" CO molecules to C2H4 on the surface of Cu NPs are expected to lead to an increase in the local pH, which is also beneficial for the C2H4 production.

Comparing the Faradaic selectivity of formate as a function of the applied electrode potential and electrolysis time, it is found that CuO incorporation can significantly improve the activity of SnO2-CuO composite catalysts. When the ratio of CuO in the bulk composite was 50%, the formed SnO2(50%)-CuO( 50%) nanocomposite gives the best catalytic performance with the onset potential as early as -0.75 V and the current density at -1.25 V as high as about-24 mA cm(-2).

The outstanding stability of SnO2 nanocatalyst fabricated electrode is also evidenced due to the stronger synergistic effect induced by CuO compositing, where the SnO2(50%)-CuO (50%) composite catalyst keeps a steady current density without any dropt over 30 h' continuous electrolysis approach.

ZnO supported on CNT is a low-cost electro catalyst that can produce syngas from CO2 and H2O. A rational catalyst design strategy for further improvement of the ZnO/CNT catalyst is to dope with copper to strengthen the binding energy of the CO intermediate, which could improve the activity. In this work, a series of CuZnO/CNT catalysts with intimate Cu and Zn contact and various Cu loadings are prepared. By varying the copper content we show that the synergy of copper and zinc improves the activity for CO formation, and the optimal copper content is 20 at%. On hydrogen evolution, the addition of copper has a two-fold effect. This reaction is enhanced by the reduced ZnO particle size obtained when copper is added, but at similar particle sizes of ZnO, a suppression is observed with increasing copper content as CO evolution is enhanced. Stability tests showed that pure ZnO phase is more stable than metallic copper on ZnO. Compared with polycrystalline silver, the CuZnO/CNT catalysts are more active for syngas formation at a useful CO: H-2 composition. This work demonstrates that the viability of DFT based rational design of electrochemical CO2 reduction catalyst.

In present study, an approach to promote ethanol production is employed through adding Au, which is favorable toward CO formation, onto Cu2O catalysts. Namely, the Cu2O hollow nanospheres with a size of 150-180 nm were synthesized by a soft template method, and then Au nanoparticles of similar to 7 nm were loaded to obtain Aux/Cu2O composites. The Aux/Cu2O catalysts have an earlier onset for ethanol production than Cu2O. Besides, Aux/Cu2O catalysts display the significantly enhanced Faraday efficiencies (FEs) of CO and ethanol, the suppressed hydrogen evolution reaction and the slightly weakened HCOOH formation. Among them, Au-0.17/Cu2O stands out with the highest FEs of ethanol from 10.8%-16.2% throughout the measuring potentials, suggesting an optimal amount of Au. Furthermore, it is found that the FEs of ethanol increase as the atomic ratio of Au/Cu increases at the medium reduction potentials (-1.1 V to -1.3 V). Besides, it is demonstrated that ethanol formation is more favorable over ethylene formation, evidenced by the ratio of FEethanol/FEethylene reaching 2.0, 3.3, 4.1 on three Au-x/Cu2O catalysts, respectively. This correlation between the ethanol production and the Au amount reflects that Au plays a crucial role in promoting ethanol formation. The enhanced ethanol formation is ascribed to more CO formation on Au sites to promote C-C coupling.

However, the energy required for CO2 activation and the subsequent required multiple number of proton-coupled electron transfer steps, makes this process very challenging. Besides, catalytic material limitations hamper the application of this technology in the short term. Consequently, in this work we synthesise, characterise and preliminarily evaluate bimetallic Cu-based hollow fibre electrodes with a compact three-dimensional geometry to overcome mass transfer limitations and to enhance the electrochemical conversion of CO2. The Cu hollow fibres are functionalised with Au in an attempt to tune the binding energy of the CO* intermediate, which appears to be key in the reduction of CO2. The Cu fibres are also functionalised with Ni, aiming to decrease the reaction overpotential, resulting in beneficial energy efficiency. The so prepared Cu-based porous hollow fibre electrodes are obtained by dry-wet spinning and electrodeposition procedures. The materials are then characterised by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analyses and cyclic voltammetry. Finally, preliminary results of CO2 electroreduction in a divided three-electrode cell are reported.

The lower value of reduction potential in case of cobalt ([Co+(aq) + 2e(-) -> Co(s)], -0.28 eV) compared to copper ([Cu2+(aq) +2 e(-) -> Cu(s)], +0.34 eV) makes Co(0) easily susceptible to galvanic exchange process.

Herein, we report a facile synthetic method of CuO/Bi (OH)3 anchored on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by the two-step chemical hydrolysis in alkaline ethanol solution for ECO2RR. Bimetallic CuBi nanoparticles are demonstrated as electrocatalytical active centers. By varying the Cu: Bi atomic fraction, we report for the first time to tune the ECO2RR products selectivity from CO to formate. At -0.99 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), CuBi-#4 (YBi = 9.1%) and CuBi-#8 (YBi = 19.2%) exhibit the tunable CO and formate Faradaic efficiency (FE) as 60% and 96%, respectively, surpassing the monometallic counterpart in selectivity and activity. Small amount of Bi dramatically alters the catalytic behavior of Cu in CuBi-#4 by stabilizing the *COOH and weakening the binding strength of *CO to improve CO2-to-CO conversion. By further increasing Bi content, the CO2RR pathway is switched from *COOH to *OCHO, giving rise to a pronounced formate selectivity in CuBi-#8.

In this work we propose a strategy of introducing crystal defects to change the reaction pathway and avoid accumulation of carbon on the Cu electrode surface, thus preventing its deactivation. Our experimental results show that carbon accumulation vanished and catalytic stability improved after crystal defects had been introduced into nano Cu electrodes. The correlation between the two rules: (1) crystal defects facilitate C2H4 formation while suppress CH4 generation; (2) crystal defects improve catalytic stability, reveals that the C2H4 formation pathway bypasses the carbon deposition associated with CH4 formation and results in stable catalytic performance. In particular, the Cu catalyst prepared according to this principle performed with good stability for 6 h almost without any change in Faradaic efficiency.

Cu foam naturally possesses three-dimensional (3D) porous structure and catalytically active Cu elements, exhibiting very good catalytic ability for ERCD. Herein, nanostructured self-supporting Cu electrodes with Cu foam as the substrate, with progressive morphologies of nanowires (CuNW), nanosheets (CuNS) and nanoflowers (CuNF), are in-situ prepared by simply adjusting the reaction time in a strongly alkaline oxidizing solution. It is found that the performance and products distribution of ERCD are affected by both the morphology of the as prepared nanostructured self-supporting Cu electrodes and the electrolyte species. As electrode micromorphology evolves from nanowire to nanoflower, the initial electrode potential required for C-2 products generation shifts to more positive values. The CuNS electrode shows the highest Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 86.9% at -0.4 V (vs. RHE) and superior performance, owing to its nanosheet morphology that can better stabilize the intermediate state products. Moreover, both total FE and products distribution are affected by the electrolyte anion species. The highest total FE in the investigated electrolyte on CuNS electrode obeys the following order: KHCO3 (86.9%, -0.4 V (vs. RHE)) > KCl (54.7%, -0.5 V (vs. RHE)) > KH2PO4 (1.0%, -0.9 V (vs. RHE)). In 1.0 mol L-1 KHCO3, the CuNS electrode shows a very complex products distribution; in 1.0 mol L-1 KCl, the products distribution can be feasibly controlled by the applied potential; while in 1.0 mol(-1) L KH2PO4, ERCD is almost totally suppressed by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It is the first time that the CuNS electrodes are applied for ERCD with low cost, simple synthesis, easy scale-up and high activity. Combined with the flexible control ability in FE and products distribution, CuNS electrode possesses great potential for the industrial application of ERCD. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The generation of products and the said distribution depend on the various methods and materials like catalysts, electrodes, electrolytes, selectively proton permeable membrane used in the reduction process, numbers of available hydrogen ions at the cathodic catalytic surface and its adsorption characteristics on the catalysts surface dispersed on the cathode. Copper (Cu) and cuprous oxide (Cu2O) nanocatalysts have been synthesized and characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) for finding the differences in their surface characteristics in order to explain the selectivity of product in their use as catalysts. The efficacy of the reduction process with the synthesized catalysts is studied in the customized electrolytic cell. Methanol is selectively produced by using Cu2O nanocatalyst as a cathode in an aqueous electrolyte, potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3), whereas methane and ethylene are formed predominantly with Cu nanocatalysts. The cathodic potential applied to the electrolytic cell with Cu2O as a catalyst on the cathode is optimized at -2.0 V vs. SHE for both the methanol selectivity and also for the minimization of undesired hydrogen evolution.

Electrocatalytic reduction seems to be a very promising technology to help to reduce industrial CO2 emissions. The development of catalysts capable of activating the CO2 molecule is the main challenge of this technology. In this work a copper supported on carbon nanotubes (Cu/CNT) catalyst has been synthesized using supercritical fluid deposition (SFD) and assembled into a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) type cell to carry out the electrochemical reduction of CO2. The influence of current density, temperature and CO2 flowrate has been analysed and results have been compared with those previously obtained with Pt/CNT and Pb/CNT catalysts synthesized by SFD. The CO2 reduction rate and the products distribution attained with the three catalysts have been analysed. CO has been the main reaction product attained with the Cu/CNT catalyst developed in this work, followed by small amounts of formic acid and methane. This can be considered the main difference observed in relation with Pt or Pb based catalysts that promote the production of formic acid as main reaction product. CO2 conversion rate increases with temperature and CO2 flowrate and is much higher than that attained when using Pt or Pb based catalysts in the same experimental conditions (up to 27 times higher depending on the experimental conditions).

An upshift of the d-band center and opposite binding energy shifts of Cu and Pd core levels were experimentally observed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This perturbation of the surface electronic structure of the CuPd/C nanoparticles leads to the lowering of the bonding strength of key adsorbate species for both the formate oxidation and electrochemical CO2 reduction, which increased the catalytic activity toward both reactions.

The C-C coupling process, as the most critical step for generating C-2/multi-carbon fuels, strongly depends on the concentration of *CO intermediates around the active sites. In this work, we prepared porous copper nanospheres (P-Cu) that greatly improved the C-C coupling process by enriching *CO intermediates in the pore structure.

Obviously, the P-Cu exhibits higher specific surface area and richer pore structure than the control sample compact copper nanosphere (C-Cu). The CO gas sensor and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) tests prove that the P-Cu has better CO adsorption and enrichment capacity than C-Cu due to the rich pore structure.

Crystalline nanosheets of this compound that show a preferential [00I] facet orientation exhibit undiminished CO2 RR activity after 16 hours with full retention of crystal structure and surface chemical speciation and no detectable corrosion. In contrast to the range of products formed on Cu metal, CuO, and Cu2O, the CO2RR on Cu3P [00I] produces mainly hydrogen and formate as the sole carbon product in KHCO3 electrolyte. Analysis of the Cu3P [00I] facet by HAADF-STEM was used to determine the surface lattice structure, while both XPS and Auger spectroscopies were used to determine the surface chemical speciation from the kinetic energies of ionized electrons. The presented analysis identifies isolated trigonal CuP3 sites on the Cu3P[00I]-Cu3P3 terminated surface and the Cu(I) oxidation state as precursor to the active catalyst. The CO2 RR selectivity to formate and the higher turnover rate for H-2 production on the [00I] facet allows a structure-activity analysis and chemical mechanism to be proposed. Formation of a surface hydride at isolated *H-CuP3 sites is proposed as the catalytic site in forming both H-2 and formate, while the long Cu-Cu separation retards forming C-C coupling products. These results disprove previously published claims of Cu(I) oxidation state as a sufficient criterion to promote CO2RR to C2+ products, show that stronger bonded hydrides, *H-CuP3 on Cu3P, favor production of the Cl product formate over all other carbon products, and predict that stronger formate binding (bidentate) is needed for CO2RR currents to compete with H-2 production.

However, it is still a great challenge in large-scale synthesis of electrocatalysts for C2+ compounds production with high selectivity and rate in neutral electrolyte. In this study, a robust and scalable aqueous synthesis method was proposed to prepare CuO nanosheets, which was directly used as CO2RR electrocatalyst. The catalyst underwent dynamic restructuring during the pre-reduction stage, which significantly changed the morphology, crystalline structure and electrochemical properties of the catalyst. As a result, the pristine CuO nanosheets gradually evolved to corallike Cu nanoparticle ensembles (CL-Cu NEs). In 0.1 M KHCO3 at -1.1 V vs. RHE, the CL-Cu NEs exhibited a faradaic efficiency and partial current density of C2+ products of 72.1% and 25.2 mA cm(-2) respectively and no degradation was observed in 15 h running. In contrast to many Cu-based catalysts showing considerable C2+ products selectivity, the (sub)surface oxygen and Cu' species were unlikely to play a significant role in this study. The strong performance of CL-Cu NEs was ascribed to the synergism between the coral-like morphology and abundant Cu(1 0 0)/Cu(1 1 1) interfaces.

The current barrier to this technique is the low efficiency of C-C coupling through dimerization of adsorbed *CO or coupling of *CO with its hydrogenated derivatives over the Cu catalyst. Tandem catalysts, which integrate Cu with another CO-generation catalyst (e.g., ZnO), can enhance the C-C coupling kinetics by increasing the local concentration of the key intermediate of CO. However, the degree of enhancement is strongly dependent on the spatial manipulation of supplementary CO transport. Herein, inspired by the reactant species concentration profile in a plug flow reactor, Cu/ZnO tandem electrodes are designed by spatially adding a ZnO catalyst layer on top of the Cu catalyst layer, in which the ZnO catalyst layer fed CO concentration progressively decreases over the Cu catalyst layer. Such a spatial management of CO transport dramatically increases the CO utilization efficiency, leading to an enhancement of Faradaic efficiency and partial current density of C2+ products by 1.2 and 3.4 times, respectively, compared to the bare Cu electrode, while by 1.3 and 1.8 times, respectively, compared to the Cu&ZnO mixed electrode.

Copper (Cu-0) is considered to be an effective electrochemical catalyst for such purpose. However, it is limited by its instability and low selectivity. In this work, Cu2+ was embedded into a polycondensation structure of resorcinol (R) and formaldehyde (F) via sol-gel reaction, and the complex was then calcined at high temperature to obtain copper nanoparticles-dispersed carbon aerogels (Cu/CA). The samples were further activated sequentially under CO2 and N-2 atmosphere. The final products under different activation temperature of secondary N-2 atmosphere were obtained and marked as Cu/CA-CO2-N-2-T. The existence of highly dispersed Cu-0 on the carbon aerogels was confirmed by XPS and HRTEM, which exhibited attractive activity towards electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) forming carbon product in 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous media. Furthermore, the CO2 RR product distribution varied under different samples.

Further calcination led to more exposure of copper, and CO dimerization to C2 product. The high selectivity toward CO by Cu/CA-CO2-N-2-700 maybe attributed to their excellent stability in maintaining the metallic nature of Cu component within the hydrophobic carbon aerogels during electrocatalysis, which further prevents the adsorption and reduction of CO on the catalyst.

The surface electronic structure related to the Cu:Au ratio in the CuxAuy NWAs could be facilely modulated by controlling the electrodeposition potential and the as-fabricated CuxAuy NWAs could be directly used as the catalytic electrode for the CO2RR. The morphology of the high-aspect-ratio nanowire array significantly lowers the onset potential of the alcohol formation due to the diffusion-induced enhancement of the local pH and CO concentration near the nanowire surface. Besides, the properly adjusted surface electronic structure of the CuxAuy NWA enables the adsorption of CO and facilitates the subsequent CO reduction to ethanol via the C-C coupling pathway. Owing to the synergistic effect of morphology and electronic structure, the optimized CuxAuy NWA selectively reduces CO2 to ethanol at low potentials of -0.5--0.7 V vs. RHE with a highest Faradaic efficiency of 48%.

Here, we show that a Cu-Ag tandem catalyst on a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) can enhance the C2+ production rate from CO2 through CO2 reduction to CO on Ag and subsequent carbon coupling on Cu. With added Ag, the C2+ partial current over a Cu surface increases from 37 to 160 mA/cm(2) at 0.70 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 1 M KOH with no mutual interference between the two metals. Moreover, the intrinsic C2H4 and C2H5 OH activity in the tandem platform is significantly higher than Cu alone under either pure CO2 or CO atmosphere. Our results indicate that the CO-enriched local environment generated by Ag can enhance C(2+ )formation on Cu beyond CO2 or CO feeding, suggesting new mechanisms in a tandem three-phase environment.\nDoi:10.1016_j.joule.2020.07.009", "label": [[6, 11, "Cu-M"], [415, 418, "C2+"], [900, 1008, "composite"]]}

Herein, we synthesize palladium-copper bimetallic nanoparticles with different compositions, which serve as a well-defined platform to understand their fundamental catalytic activity in CO2 reduction.

Ag and Cu remain fully phase-segregated in the as deposited bimetallic foam exhibiting a high degree of dispersion of pure nm-sized Ag domains embedded in the Cu matrix. An activation of this bimetallic material towards ethanol formation is achieved by thermal annealing of the as deposited foam under mild conditions (200 degrees C for 12 h). Such annealing quantitatively transforms the Cu in the bimetallic system into a mixture of crystalline Cu2O and amorphous CuO whereas the Ag remains in its metallic state due to the thermal instability of Ag2O above temperatures of 180 degrees C.

One of the most important challenges of this technology is the development of catalysts that allow obtaining high efficiencies in the reduction of the CO2 molecule.

In this work, we synthesize a series of porous bimetallic Cu-Sb alloys with different compositions for the catalytic reduction of CO2 to C2H4.

Cu is the only single metal catalyst that can electrochemically convert CO2 into multicarbon products. However, Cu exhibits an unfavorable activity and selectivity for the generation of C-2 products because of the insufficient amount of CO* provided for the C-C coupling. Based on the strong CO2 adsorption and ultrafast reaction kinetics of CO* formation on Pd, an intimate CuPd(100) interface was designed to lower the intermediate reaction barriers and improve the efficiency of C-2 product formation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the CuPd(100) interface enhanced the CO2 adsorption and decreased the CO2* hydrogenation energy barrier, which was beneficial for the C-C coupling. The potential-determining step (PDS) barrier of CO2 to C-2 products on the CuPd(100) interface was 0.61 eV, which was lower than that on Cu(100) (0.72 eV). Encouraged by the DFT calculation results, the CuPd(100) interface catalyst was prepared by a facile chemical solution method and characterized by transmission electron microscopy. CO2 temperature-programmed desorption and gas sensor experiments further confirmed the enhancement of the CO2 adsorption and CO2* hydrogenation ability of the CuPd(100) interface catalyst.

To do so requires efficient, selective, and stable catalysts. In this study, we report a highly mesoporous metallic Cu catalyst prepared by electrochemical reduction of thermally nitrided Cu foil. Under aqueous saturated CO2 reduction conditions, the Cu3N-derived Cu electrocatalyst produces virtually no CH4, very little CO, and exhibits a faradaic efficiency of 68% in C2+ products (C2H4, C2H5OH, and C3H7OH) at a current density of similar to 18.5 mA cm(-2) and a cathode potential of -1.0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Under these conditions, the catalyst produces more oxygenated products than hydrocarbons. We show that surface roughness is a good descriptor of catalytic performance. The roughest surface reached 98% CO utilization efficiency for C-2, product formation from CO2 reduction and the ratio of oxygenated to hydrocarbon products correlates with the degree of surface roughness.

We report here an investigation of the effects of four different preparations of oxide-derived electrocatalysts on their activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction, with particular attention given to the selectivity to products. All catalysts were tested for CO2 reduction in 0.1 M KHCO3 and 0.1 M CsHCO3 at applied voltages in the range from -0.7 to -1.0 V vs RHE. The best performing oxide-derived catalysts show up to similar to 70% selectivity to C2+ products and only similar to 3% selectivity to C-1 products at -1.0 V vs RHE when CsHCO3 is used as the electrolyte. In contrast, the selectivity to C2+ products decreases to similar to 56% for the same catalysts tested in KHCO3. By studying all catalysts under identical conditions, the key factors affecting product selectivity could be discerned. These efforts reveal that the surface area of the oxide-derived layer is a critical parameter affecting selectivity. A high selectivity to C2+ products is attained at an overpotential of -1 V vs RHE by operating at a current density sufficiently high to achieve a moderately high pH near the catalyst surface but not so high as to cause a significant reduction in the local concentration of CO2.

The ability to control the surface structure of CO2RR nanocatalysts provides an opportunity to tune product selectivity. Bimetallic gold-copper catalysts have been identified as emerging electrocatalyst candidates, but Cu incorporation typically lowers product selectivity compared with pure Au. Here we show sustained CO selectivity and activity up to 49% Cu content in small (<2 nm), thiol-capped Au/Cu nanoparticles (NPs). Bimetallic NPs containing 49% Cu selectivity converted CO2 into CO with 100 +/- 6% CO Faradaic efficiency and average mass activity of similar to 500 mA/mg during a 12 h electrolysis experiment at -0.8 V vs RHE. Au/Cu NPs synthesized without thiol ligands selectively produced H-2, whereas larger (>10 nm), thermally dethiolated Au/Cu NPs produced a wider product distribution including H-2, CO, and C2H4. Density functional theory (DFT) modeling of CO2RR and H-2 evolution at realistic, thiol-capped Au/Cu NP structures indicated that copper thiol surface structures sustained CO selectivity by stabilizing key *CO intermediates while making *H binding less favorable. Calculations also predicted that removing a significant fraction of the thiol ligands would increase *CO binding strength such that desorption of CO product molecules could become the most thermodynamically challenging step. This result, coupled with increased *H stability on dethiolated nanoclusters, points to decreased CO2RR selectivity for small, ligand-free catalysts, which is in line with experimental observations from our group and others.

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of the electrochemical CO2 reduction on an electrodeposited Cu3Sn alloy by experimental and theoretical analyses. The electrodeposited Cu3Sn alloy electrode showed selectivity for CO production at all the applied potentials, and HCOOH production increased with an increase in the applied potential. In particular, hydrocarbon generation was well suppressed on Cu3Sn(002). To understand this selectivity change in electrochemical CO, reduction, we conducted density functional theory calculations for the reaction on the Cu3Sn(002) surface. According to the theoretical analysis, the Cu sites in Cu3Sn(002) contributed more to the stabilization of H*, COOH*, and CO* as compared with the Sn sites.

Herein, an oxidative etching of Au20Cu80 alloy is used for the synthesis of a nanoporous Au3Cu alloy, representing a facile strategy for tuning the surface electronic properties and altering the adsorption behavior of the intermediates. HRTEM, XPS, and EXAFS results reveal that the curved surface of the synthesized nanoporous Au3Cu is rich in gold with unsaturated coordination conditions.

The FE is 1.47 times that over the as-made single nanoporous Au. Density functional theory reveals that *CO has a relatively long distance on the surface of nanoporous Au3Cu, making desorption of CO easier and avoiding CO poisoning. The Hirshfeld charge distribution shows that the Au atoms have a negative charge and the Cu atoms exhibit a positive charge, which separately bond to the C atom and O atom in the *COOH intermediate through a bidentate mode.

The sensitive dependence of the experimental ethylene selectivity on catalyst particle areal density is attributed to a diffusional interparticle coupling that controls the de- and re-adsorption of CO and thus the effective coverage of COad intermediates.

In this work, we designed a sulfur-doped Cu2O-derived Cu catalyst and showed that the presence of sulfur can tune the selectivity of Cu significantly from the production of various CO2 reduction products to almost exclusively formate. Sulfur is doped into the Cu catalysts by dipping the Cu substrates into ammonium polysulfide solutions. Catalyst films with the highest sulfur content of 2.7at% showed the largest formate current density (jHCOO- ) of -13.9mAcm(-2) at -0.9V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is approximately 46 times larger than that previously reported for Cu(110) surfaces. At -0.8V versus RHE, the faradaic efficiency of formate was maintained at approximately 75% for 12h of continuous electrolysis. Through the analysis of the evolution of the jHCOO- and jH2 values with the sulfur content, we show that sulfur doping increases formate production and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction. Ag-S and Cu-Se catalysts did not exhibit any significant enhancement towards the reduction of CO2 to formate. This demonstrates clearly that sulfur and copper acted synergistically to promote the selective formation of formate.

Nevertheless, such Cu catalysts suffer from poor selectivity. High pressure of CO2 is considered to facilitate the activity and selectivity of CO2 reduction. Herein, a new strategy is presented for CO2 reduction with improved C2H4 selectivity on a Cu catalyst by using CO2 capture materials as the support at ambient pressure. N-doped carbon (NxC) was synthesized through high-temperature carbonization of melamine and L-lysine. We observed that the CO2 uptake capacity of NxC depends on both the microporous area and the content of pyridinic N species, which can be controlled by the carbonization temperature (600-800 degrees C). The as-prepared CuO/NxC catalysts exhibit a considerably higher C2H4 faradaic efficiency (36%) than CuO supported on XC-72 carbon black (19%), or unsupported CuO (20%). Moreover, there is a good linear relationship between the C2H4 faradaic efficiency and CO2 uptake capacity of the supports for CuO. The local high CO2 concentration near Cu catalysts, created by CO2 capture materials, was proposed to increase the coverage of CO intermediate, which is favorable for the coupling of two CO units in the formation of C2H4. This study demonstrates that pairing Cu catalysts with CO2 capture supports is a promising approach for designing highly effective CO2 reduction electrocatalysts.\nDoi:10.1002_cssc.201702338", "label": [[959, 963, "C2H4"], [985, 988, "Faradaic efficiency"], [66, 69, "CuOx"], [1447, 1580, "composite"]]}

Here, a tandem electrocatalyst composed of copper nanocubes and nickel-coordinated nitrogen-doped carbon (NiNC) is presented, which is integrated into gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) for direct conversion of vapor-fed CO2 into ethylene. Evaluation of tandem GDEs in the vapor-fed flow electrolyzer shows significantly increased ethylene selectivity in terms of faradaic efficiency and C2H4/CO ratio compared to a non-tandem copper GDE. The enhancements are attributed to the increased local CO availability near the copper surface via effective CO2 to CO conversion on neighboring NiNC. The experimental results are validated by 3D resolved continuum simulations, which show increased flux of higher-order products with the added CO flux from NiNC. The practical viability of Cu/NiNC catalyst is further evaluated in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer, achieving 40% FE toward ethylene at 150 mA cm(-2) and 3.2 V.

Cu-based materials are the most promising catalysts to realize C-2 products from CO2 reduction, while, they often suffer from the poor selectivity and efficiency. Here, it is shown that -NH2-modified carbon dots (NCDs) can regulate the electron transfer behavior on Cu/CuO catalyst, and then enhance the CO2 conversion selectivity to C2H4. The selectivity of C2H4 (in carbon products) on NCDs/Cu/CuO composites is increased by 1.2 times when compared with that of Cu/CuO catalysts. NCDs increase the adsorption capacity of catalysts to CO2 by 18.2%. Transient photo-induced voltage (TPV) tests are used to reveal the effect of NCDs on electron transfer behavior at the catalyst interface. On one hand, NCDs reduce the electron transfer resistance between Cu/CuO particles, increasing the overall electron transfer rate by 37%; on the other hand, NCDs with electron sink effect can increase the electron concentration on catalyst surface significantly.

Several approaches including the fabrication of oxide-derived structures, atomic surface control, and the Cu+/Cu interfaces have been primarily used to produce ethanol from CO2.

The resulting electrocatalyst shows an ethanol selectivity of 43% at -0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is one of the highest ethanol selectivity values reported thus far.

We report flexible Cu(I) triazolate frameworks as efficient, stable, and tunable electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to C2H4/CH4.

Density functional theory indicates that the heterogeneous structure between Cu2O and carbon is expected to inhibit C2H5OH production and promote C-C coupling, which facilitates C2H4 production. To prove this, a composite electrode containing octahedral Cu2O nanoparticles (NPs) (o-Cu2O) with {111} facets and carbon NPs is constructed, which experimentally inhibits C2H5OH production while strongly enhancing C2H4 selectivity compared with o-Cu2O electrode. Furthermore, the surface hydroxylation of carbon can further improve the C2H4 production of o-Cu2O/C electrode, exhibiting a high C2H4 Faradaic efficiency of 67% and a high C2H4 current density of 45 mA cm(-2) at -1.1 V in a near-neutral electrolyte.

In particular, grain boundaries on the catalysts contribute to the generation of various Cu coordination environments, which have been found essential for C-C coupling. However, smooth-surfaced Cu2O nanocrystals generally lack the ability for the surface reorganization to form multiple grain boundaries and desired Cu undercoordination sites. Flow chemistry armed with the unparalleled ability to mix reaction mixture can achieve a very high concentration of unstable reaction intermediates, which in turn are used up rapidly to lead to kinetics-driven nanocrystal growth. Herein, the synthesis of a unique hierarchical structure of Cu2O with numerous steps (h-Cu2O ONS) via flow chemistry-assisted modulation of nanocrystal growth kinetics is reported. The surface of h-Cu2O ONS underwent rapid surface reconstruction under CO2RR conditions to exhibit multiple heterointerfaces between Cu2O and Cu phases, setting the preferable condition to facilitate C-C bond formation. Notably, the h-Cu2O ONS obtained the increased C2H4 Faradaic efficiency from 31.9% to 43.5% during electrocatalysis concurrent with the morphological reorganization, showing the role of the stepped surface.

In this work, a bimetallic, low-entropy state Cu-3 Sn catalyst featuring efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to ethanol is developed.

In this work, surface cavity effect on C2H4 formation was investigated using Cu2O cubes: solid cubes, cavity cubes, and broken cubes, typically representing smooth surface, cavity surface, and rough surface. With respect of C2H4 selectivity, cavity cubes show the significantly enhanced faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2H4, which is 2.7 and 1.7 times higher than those for solid cubes and broken cubes respectively. Moreover, a ratio of CO produced by CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) converted to CH4 and C2H4 was calculated to assess the extent of CO further reduction for a catalyst. As noted, cavity cubes exhibited a highest ratio of 29.5%, in contrast with the lower ratio of 13.0% on broken cubes and 14.9% on solid cubes. Consequently, the role of surface cavity is reflected in two effects, the increased CO formation due to higher electrochemical surface area as compared to the smooth surface, and meanwhile the increased ratio of CO converted to hydrocarbons and alcohols due to porous feature as compared to the rough surface with a comparable high electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). What's more, when applied in a flow cell reactor with a gas diffusion electrode, cavity cubes also achieved much higher C2 selectivity of 37.7% FEC2 than solid cubes and broken cubes.

Thus, this paper proposes a facial and effective strategy to reinforce Cu (100) facet, and couple and heighten the virtues of ionic liquid and Cu during CO2ER toward C2.\n\nDOI:10.1016_j.fuel.2022.124103", "label": [[914, 1008, "composite"], [24, 26, "Cu"], [1016, 1024, "C2H4"], [1032, 1038, "Faradaic efficiency"]]}

To develop the process on a large scale, it would be essential to use selective and cheap electrodes, and to get high production rate with low energy consumptions. Cu-In catalysts are one of the most intriguing in this context because of their inexpensive cost, high Faradaic efficiency in CO (FECO), and excellent stability. However, because of the low current densities demonstrated in aqueous electrolytes, productivities have been rather low up to date. This paper shows that the morphological and interface engineering of 3D Cu/In nanocones designed by facile electrodeposition can perform very well for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction to syngas. Under 1 atm of CO(2 )pressure and -0.6 V to -1.1 V versus RHE, the current density can reach -20 mA cm(-2) with a FE of 100%. Besides, an increase in CO2 pressure as high as 9.5 bars has increased the content of CO2, which enabled CO partial current density (j(CO)) to achieve-229.88 mA cm(-2), a new record in neutral pH electrolyte for most of the Cu-based electrodes.

Herein we fabricated composition tunable Cu-In hydroxides (CuxIny-OH) by the hydrothermal method and studied their composition effect on electrochemical CO2 reduction in detail. Wefound that the selectivity of CO2 reduction products shifted from CO to formate when the content of In increased in the CuxIny-OH electrocatalysts. The Cu rich electrocatalyst mostly produced CO, which could achieve a Faradaic efficiency (FE) to 75.8% at -0.59 V vs. RHE (Cu76In24 based electrocatalysts). In comparison, the In rich electrocatalysts selectively produced formate, which possessed the FE of formate up to 85% at -1.01 V vs. RHE.

X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) tests showed that the metal mainly loaded on the carbon matrix in the form of metallic Co/Cu, and a part metal was doped into the carbon matrix in the form of MN. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) showed that the metallic Co/Cu uniformly distributed on the carbon matrix because of the wrapping by carbon matrix. Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) test displayed that CoCu-N-C composites exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity than Co-N-C for CO2 reduction. The Faradic efficiency (FE %) of CH4, CO and H-2 of CoCu(1:3)-N-C-900 at-0.53 V(vs. RHE) was 21%, 35% and 30%, respectively.

Optimizing the C-C coupling process, the rate-determining step for C-2 product generation, is an important strategy to improve the production and selectivity of the C-2 products. In this study, we determined that the local electric field can promote the C-C coupling reaction and enhance CO2 electroreduction to C-2 products. First, finite-element simulations indicated that the high curvature of the Cu nanoneedles results in a large local electric field on their tips. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations proved that a large electric field can promote C-C coupling. Motivated by this prediction, we prepared a series of Cu catalysts with different curvatures. The Cu nanoneedles (NNs) exhibited the largest number of curvatures, followed by the Cu nanorods (NRs), and Cu nanoparticles (NPs). The Cu NNs contained the highest concentration of adsorbed K+, which resulted in the highest local electric field on the needles. CO adsorption sensor tests indicated that the Cu NNs exhibited the strongest CO adsorption ability, and in-situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) showed the strongest *COCO and *CO signals for the Cu NNs. These experimental results demonstrate that high-curvature nanoneedles can induce a large local electric field, thus promoting C-C coupling.

Following that line of research, we report in this work the application of a sputter gas aggregation source (SGAS) and a multiple ion cluster source type apparatus, for the controlled synthesis of CuOx nanoparticles (NPs) atop gas diffusion electrodes. By varying the mass loading, we achieve control over the balance between methanation and multicarbon formation in a gas-fed CO2 electrolyzer and obtain peak CH4 partial current densities of -143 mA cm(-2) (mass activity of 7.2 kA/g) with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 48% and multicarbon partial current densities of -231 mA cm(-2) at 76% FE (FEC2H4 = 56%).

We show that the combination of the O-2 flow rate to the aggregation zone during NP growth and deposition time, which affect the NP production rate and mass loading, respectively, gives rise to the formation of either densely packed CuOx NPs or rough three-dimensional networks made from CuOx NP building blocks, which in turn affects the governing CO2RR mechanism.

As part of ongoing upscaling efforts, it is a matter of interest to investigate whether the high selectivity toward ethylene of copper nanocubes, which show a preferential (100) orientation, is maintained in gas-fed electrolyzers, thus enabling the energy-efficient production of this valuable commodity chemical at industrially relevant current densities.

The copper nanocube-loaded GDEs maintained high Faradaic efficiencies toward ethylene at elevated total current densities, resulting in higher overall partial current densities toward this product compared to benchmark electrodes. Interestingly, CO2 reduction to propylene, albeit with low partial current densities, was also observed.

Herein, Cu-decorated CeO2 composites (Cu-y/CeO2) with distinct interfacial characteristics were fabricated through a highly controllable synthesis, based on chemical prelithiation of CeO2 and then galvanic displacement with Cu.

Among products from CO2RR, multicarbon chemicals, such as ethylene and ethanol with high energy density, are more valuable. However, the selectivity and reaction rate of C-2 production are unsatisfactory due to the sluggish thermodynamics and kinetics of C-C coupling. The electric field and thermal field have been studied and utilized to promote catalytic reactions, as they can regulate the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers of reactions. Either raising the potential or heating the electrolyte can enhance C-C coupling, but these come at the cost of increasing side reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction.

A conformal coating of similar to 5 nm of polytetrafluoroethylene significantly improves the catalytic ability of copper nanoneedles (similar to 7-fold electric field and similar to 40 K temperature enhancement at the tips compared with bare copper nanoneedles experimentally), resulting in an improved C-2 Faradaic efficiency of over 86% at a partial current density of more than 250 mA cm(-2) and a record-high C-2 turnover frequency of 11.5 +/- 0.3 s(-1) Cu site(-1).

However, under the cathodic potential of CRR conditions, the chemical composition of most Cu-based catalysts inevitably undergoes electroreduction from Cu2+ to Cu-0 or Cu1+ species, which is generally coupled with phase reconstruction and the formation of new active sites. Since the initial Cu2+ active sites are hard to retain, there have been few studies about Cu2+ catalysts for CRR. Herein we propose a solidsolution strategy to stabilize Cu2+ ions by incorporating them into a CeO2 matrix, which works as a self-sacrificing ingredient to protect Cu2+ active species. In situ spectroscopic characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that compared with the conventionally derived Cu catalysts with Cu-0 or Cu1+ active sites, the Cu2+ species in the solid solution (Cu-Ce-O-x) can significantly strengthen adsorption of the *CO intermediate, facilitating its further hydrogenation to produce CH4 instead of dimerization to give C-2 products.

Copper has been considered the predominant and effective electrocatalyst for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), especially when aiming for ethylene products. However, the selectivity or current density of most catalysts for ethylene production is not satisfactory at competitive prices. Here, we present a newly designed electrocatalyst comprising Al2CuO4 nanosheets uniformly covered with CuO nanoparticles (CuAl-1: CuO/Al2CuO4-23) by phase and interphase engineering, achieving an ultrahigh selectivity of 82.4% for ethylene in an H-cell system with good catalytic stability and material durability for 100 h. In a flow-cell electrolyzer, this catalyst achieves a remarkably high ethylene partial current density of 421 mA cm(-2), substantially higher than the as-synthesized bare CuO (261 mA cm(-2)) counterpart. The results of time-resolved attenuated total reflection-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) suggest that compared to the CuO catalyst, CuAl-1 enabled high surface coverages of *CO intermediates and strengthened adsorption of *CO for C-C coupling toward *OCCO, which is an intermediate for the production of ethylene. X-ray absorption analysis confirms that Cu oxide species in CuAl-1 are well retained during CO2 reduction, whereas the bare CuO catalyst is completely reduced to the metallic Cu state. Density functional theory calculations propose that a synergistic effect between CuO and Al2CuO4 in the CuAl-1 steers the CO2RR pathway towards ethylene.\n\nDOI:10.1039_d1ee03861c", "label": [[58, 67, "C2H4"], [24, 35, "CuOx-MOx"], [891, 896, "Faradaic efficiency"], [1781, 1882, "composite"]]}

In this manuscript, a simple and effective plasma-activated strategy is employed to synthesize a MOF-based single-atom copper catalyst. The bombardment of plasma forms abundant oxygen vacancies and significantly increases the number of low-coordinated catalytically active copper sites. Moreover, plasma treatment also creates a hierarchically porous structure, which can effectively adsorb the reactant molecules. The synergistic effect of the porous structure and low-coordinated copper sites dramatically improves the activity of CO2 electroreduction to CH4 with a maximum faradaic efficiency of 75.3%. Furthermore, the total faradaic efficiency of carbon-containing products (CO, CH4 and C2H4) can reach as high as 96.5% with a partial current density of 47.8 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the low-coordinated copper sites can be beneficial for the formation and further reduction of the key intermediate to CH4.

Herein, we rationally design highly exfoliated two-dimensional Ti3C2Tx nanosheets (T-x = O, OH, and F) doped with Cu (denoted as Cu/Ti3C2Tx) for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The fabrication process entails the selective chemical etching of Ti3AlC2 followed by the delamination thereof under ultrasonic treatment and subsequent mixing with a Cu precursor to allow in situ doping.

The CO2RR current density of Cu/Ti3C2Tx (-1.08 mA cm(-2)) was 3.6 times higher than that of Ti3C2Tx (-0.3 mA cm(-2)) besides a lower onset reduction potential and Tafel slope, and higher stability, due to the greater surface area, electronic effect, and quicker charge transfer on Cu/Ti3C2Tx.

Unfortunately, the product selectivity and conversion efficiency during the CO2RR are severely limited by the unavoidable competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

As a result, we found that CuAg electrode of Sn addition can effectively inhibit the HER during the CO2RR and improve the selectivity of CO, and the FE of CO can reach 93% at -0.85 V. The large lattice distortions and strain effect after Sn addition affect the electronic structure and further result in the downshift of the d-band center, which causes the Gibbs free energy of the formation of *H on the CuAgSn surface to increase dramatically. Although the formation energy barrier of *COOH doesn't decrease after Sn addition, the selectivity of CO is enhanced, owing to the selective suppression of the HER.
